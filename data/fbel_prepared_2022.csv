From banners in Yankee Stadium that read ‚Äú#OustAOC‚Äù, to going on Fox to lie about Alexandria ‚Äî the attacks are ongoing.   Here‚Äôs the truth: Alexandria has delivered for her district in The Bronx and Queens. She fought for and won billions for Covid-19 funeral assistance after hearing from constituents about the painful economic toll of losing a loved one to Covid. She started an in-district tutoring program to help working parents amid lockdown and beyond, and even tutored a student herself.   Alexandria stood with Starbucks workers as they fought to unionize, and skipped Biden‚Äôs inauguration to stand with produce workers in The Bronx who were protesting for living wages. And, she stood with taxi drivers to fight for justice after they were the targets of a predatory loan scheme. The truth is, Alexandria has always been laser focused on helping the working families of NY-14.   Republicans and corporate interests can try to spread lies about our Congresswoman, but the fact stands that AOC has always and will continue to fight for us all. And that‚Äôs why we must show up for her now. If you can today, please make a contribution to help us fight back against the disinformation Republicans are working to spread about AOC.

Thanks for highlighting the differences between how we view these. I've studied economics for a long time and you help an economy by increasing production not increasing services and many of the things that my opponent is talking about don't actually generate any real growth. This short-term installation of products does not create jobs other than short-term sort of like eb-5 and jpq know I have short-term employment but not long-term long-term employment in Vermont. Could be farming production. We are not meeting the demand for the out-of-state, demand for our products, particularly meets. It's not just about milk. There is a huge demand for local Vermont brand names. We don't have enough processing facilities. We could do more for Distribution Systems. We have a lot of young people who want to do it. Why would they invest their trust fund or other money here? When taxes are so high. So I propose a specific policy. I have 14 pages of what I call the farming Manifesto. I produced it two years ago, how it is that we can take the ideas actually of a guy I named Wendell Berry and apply them and stop making it artificially impossible for local people's roofs food. We are dependent on far away food. That's produced with large amounts of fossil fuels that I agree. We need to reduce the amount of use out of toxic fruit, from China, from out west and the more those costs go up and more our Local Foods become competitive again and we should help those businesses and that's long-term growth, not just a blip while you install a heat pump. Also as far as renewable energy and heat pumps and Mark said at the outset that there was That they clean be heat. Bell was passed. I don't believe it was maybe even spoke but you did call for a tax on heating oil if we were to eliminate the taxes on not have a heating tax on oil, to try to incentivize people who can't afford it.

Approved by Paul Crisci  Hi, my name is Paul Christy and as many of you know I'm running for district twelve States Senate, every two years you have the opportunity to vote for the person you think will represent you to the best of their ability as a senator and a return, your Center has the opportunity to reciprocate by voting for what's important to you. So I guess the only question is, how many times did Christine Cohen vote for you? When it came to Public Safety, she voted against police by signing, a police accountability, act and a clean slate Bill preventing police from doing their jobs and making your neighborhoods less safe when it came to parents rights. Christine Cohen voted yes to sex education for kindergarteners and removed your right to religious exemption. And when it came the taxes, first think Owen voted every time to raise your taxes on goods and services costing, the average taxpayer over 16 thousand dollars, isn't it time we replace irrational politics with common sense? Vote for me, Paul Christy this November 8th. So, I can vote for you. I'm Paul Chrissy, I'm running for district twelve States Senate and I approve this message.

Walking away was not an option, but we needed intervention. We need. Somebody to have the courage to step forward and that's what Congressman Biggs did my staff?

x_1262931011146296,"President Biden is cancelling $10K in student debt. This is a huge moment for our movement ‚Äî this is the result of years of work by progressive advocates and activists that is going to improve so many people‚Äôs lives.   I‚Äôve said it before and I'll say it again: Not every program has to be for everybody. People with apartments pay for first time homeowner benefits. Young people pay for Medicare for our seniors. People who take public transit pay for car infrastructure.  Maybe student loan forgiveness doesn‚Äôt impact you. That doesn‚Äôt make it bad. I am sure there are certainly other things that student loan borrowers‚Äô taxes pay for. We can do good things and reject the scarcity mindset that says doing something good for someone else comes at the cost of something for ourselves.  An example: If a person is blessed enough to be in a position to have paid off their loans, maybe they have a home now and benefitted from first-time homeowners‚Äô programs that people crushed by student loans help subsidize when they aren‚Äôt able to buy a home because of student debt. It all comes around. It‚Äôs okay. We can support things we won‚Äôt directly benefit from.  And another thing... we can keep pushing. Remember that the Biden administration didn‚Äôt want to do this *at all.* It was YOUR pushing, YOUR pressure, YOUR organizing that got them to this point.   It is now up to us, and to you, to decide if we are going to stop here or if we are going to keep pushing. I am very grateful for this watershed moment of a first step ‚Äî it is encouraging, thrilling, and has already changed SO many people‚Äôs lives.

Not long after she was approved, Harry‚Äôs dad was diagnosed with cancer, passing away when Harry was 20. He then became his mother's guardian, until her passing a few years later.  During an age in his life when most people are just starting to contemplate what options they have for the future, Harry was working two jobs and dealing with wealthy healthcare corporations to get his parents the right to see a doctor and being in a care facility without going bankrupt.   But Harry Benton has persisted. He‚Äôs an ironworker, a Plainfield village trustee, a husband and a father. And now he‚Äôs ready to help all of us ‚Äî by representing us in Springfield.

So before I ask you to make a donation to my campaign for U.S. Senate, let me tell you more.  On my left arm I have the zip code 15104. That‚Äôs Braddock, PA, my home and the community I was honored to serve as Mayor for 13 years. Gisele and I are raising our kids here in Braddock, right across the street from Andrew Carnegie‚Äôs first steel mill.   On my right arm I have nine different dates. These represent the dates of people who were killed through violence in Braddock while I served as mayor, starting in 2006. Seven out of nine were gun deaths.   My first tattoo came after January 16, 2006. It was my second week on the job as mayor after winning my election by a single vote. I received a call and was summoned to a police crime scene where a pizza delivery man had been robbed and killed at gunpoint.   Every time Braddock lost someone was the worst feeling in the world. In a close-knit community like Braddock, it‚Äôs very likely that you know the victim and their family. It‚Äôs an incredibly wrenching and personal experience as a mayor ‚Äî but nothing compared to what the families have to go through.  I worked with the community to take on gun violence and other important issues that Braddock faced every day. I helped initiate youth and art programs for the students of our community and we worked together to create a community center.  We also worked to develop buildings that had been written off, kick-started our economy, and reduced deadly violence. My proudest moment as Mayor of Braddock was when our community went 5 1‚ÅÑ2 years without a gun-related death.  Now I‚Äôm running for U.S. Senate, and the honest truth is that we still need to raise a lot of money to take down my self-funding opponent, Dr. Oz, and his band of celebrity grifters.  I‚Äôm told 3 of every 4 donations to our campaign are coming through the internet. So let me ask you, internet user, will you be one of the small-dollar donors that win us this Senate seat?

x_1483321595504795,"Here‚Äôs something you probably don‚Äôt know about me ‚Äî before I ever was in politics, I convicted an FBI agent who was spying for Russia during the Cold War. This is not the usual campaign ad, but I think you‚Äôll find it interesting. Trust me.   It was a classic sex for secrets case, and the biggest case of my career. That was until I investigated Donald Trump and presented the case at his first impeachment trial.  Before I go on (and I hope you‚Äôre going to want to read on), I want to ask you to chip in to my campaign, so I can continue holding Republicans, and anyone who seeks to undermine our democracy, accountable.  Richard Miller was an FBI agent assigned to the counterintelligence division (literally the bureau meant to combat Russian influence) in Los Angeles in the early 1980s.   Miller was recruited by a Soviet emigree named Svetlana. After coming to the United States with her husband, she was disaffected with her new country and longed to go back to the USSR. But defectors were viewed as traitors by the Soviet Union and she had to earn her passage home. So she became a Russian intelligence asset, and Miller became her target. With marriage and financial difficulties, he was an easy mark.   I‚Äôll spare you the details of their sordid dalliances, which were numerous. But eventually in 1984, Svetlana made her move, telling Miller the Russians would pay him for classified documents. Miller asked for tens of thousands in cash and gold.   He drove up to San Francisco with Svetlana, and provided a Soviet intelligence officer at the Russian consulate with his FBI badge and a classified FBI counterintelligence manual to prove he could deliver.   Things only escalated from there, but the FBI caught on to Miller and put him under surveillance. Miller discovered his surveillance and went to his superiors, and concocted an alibi that he was acting as a ‚Äúsecret double agent.‚Äù He was arrested, confessed, and then walked back the confession. Svetlana and her husband would later plead guilty.  Miller‚Äôs first trial was a mistrial, and his second was overturned on appeal. We had one more chance. That‚Äôs when I was brought into the case. At the time, I was about thirty and serving as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles.  It was my first blockbuster trial. And the pressure was immense.  I prepped for months, and during that time, I came into contact with dozens and dozens of FBI agents who had worked with Miller, but also investigated him. It was a crash course in the Bureau‚Äôs counterintelligence mission ‚Äî which I got to know even better many years later during my time at the Intelligence Committee, and while investigating Trump.  The Miller trial was in 1990, so of course they gave me a pretty early version of a cell phone ‚Äî it looked like the nuclear football, it was that big! I worked on the case all day and was on that big phone with agents all night.  The trial commenced less than a year after the Berlin Wall came down and just a couple of years before the Cold War finally ended. This is part of what I told the jury in my closing argument:  ‚ÄúMiller had betrayed his job, his family, and the entire community that placed its trust in his hands ... this is a case of government misconduct and government corruption of the highest and most disturbing order.‚Äù  The jury agreed, and the weight of the evidence was enough to convict him. Miller was found guilty, and sentenced to twenty years in prison. He would go down as the first FBI agent ever convicted of espionage. Sadly, he would not be the last.   I learned a lot about the Russians during that investigation, the kind of people they target, their tradecraft, and the vulnerabilities they look for. They want people with access to information that is of use to them, and they look for people they can exploit ‚Äî with marital issues, or who are motivated by greed or resentment. The Russians found a very, very good target with Richard Miller.   I‚Äôve made it my mission in Congress to protect our country and our democracy, just as I did in the courtroom.   That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking you to donate $10, or whatever amount is meaningful to you, today, so we can all do our part to protect our Democracy and hold those who seek to weaken or destroy it accountable.

There would make it illegal for anyone to kill someone. Who provides an abortion. I'm not exaggerating. It says, anyone can use deadly force to prevent an abortion so you can kill a doctor or a nurse or anyone involved. That is not a partisan reading of the bill. That is the plain language. It's very short. So I'm in the state senate in North Carolina, a bunch of you have tagged me and ask me what's going on with this thing. So, I'll tell you next year Republicans in North Carolina in the state. Teacher are going to pass a bill Banning abortion, it's just not going to be this one. One reason we know it won't be this one is because this bill actually calls for a constitutional amendment. And in order to amend the Constitution in North Carolina, the whole state gets to vote and they would never allow the whole state to vote on this because it wouldn't pass, it would be grossly unpopular. So when they pass a bill Banning abortion and they will it won't be in the form of a constitutional amendment. It would just be a regular wall and what will the content of that band? Be, we don't exactly know. But by the looks of this bill, some of them are willing to be very extreme. Here's the thing, when they passed their bill Banning abortion, it will be vetoed by the governor and then it'll come down to. Whether there are enough Democrats in the minority to sustain the governor's veto right now. There are so we're not seeing any abortion bans but after this next election that could change will the minority party have enough members to sustain the governor's veto when they ban. Abortion is basically what this election is all about, at least when it comes to state. Void of races in North Carolina. This midterm election for State.

She's running for congress in New Hampshire. She just won the Primary. They're talking about very unsafe things. We're grateful to have her. Join us tonight. Karen, love it. Thanks so much for coming. Are you talking about this on the campaign Trail? In New Hampshire? Yes we are talking about this on the campaign Trail in New Hampshire Tucker because in fact here in New Hampshire and more than 40 school districts in our state, there are policies that prevent teachers in school administrators from informing parents about their minor children's behavior in the classroom. In fact recently in Manchester New Hampshire, our state's largest public, school district, a mother filed suit against the school because her daughter was identifying as a boy in the classroom, the teachers were going along with it and the parents had no. Yeah, well, a Democrat appointed judge. Make no mistake dismissed the mothers lawsuit and said she does not have the right to know what's going on in the classroom. I read this in the local paper and was astonished. I reach out to the mother. Personally we held a press conference in our campaign to call attention to. This policy that is prohibiting parents from raising their children and it got a lot of buzz. In fact the Democrat Party chair here in New Hampshire said that I am enabling child beaters and child's Killers. It's Lately crazy. But this is one of the reasons I'm running for congress in the first place Tucker because policies like this in the woke Democrat Party and their allies in the mainstream media, the big tech companies and certainly the Biden Administration in my Democrat opponent here in New Hampshire. Crisp apis are indoctrinating my generation. It's having a direct and immediate impact on folks, my age and even younger than me, that's why I've stepped up to run for Congress and talk about these issues because these are the issues of our time and Republicans can win on them, but we have to have the courage. To talk about it in the first place. Yeah. Sorry, Chris Pappas. You're not the head of my family. I am you're not my kids parent. I am. You know, thank you. Thank you for saying that Karin.

He convened, the governor's tribal advisory Council, which is really a powerful exercise. It was something I think part of meaningful dialogue between tribal leaders, his cabinet, the lieutenant governor and himself. Even when he didn't fully understand, he understood that we were sovereigns and as Leaders as sovereigns, he sauces peers and that's something I really admire about Governor Walker.

This is my best friend, Max. We've been together for 91, dog years is three legs. We do just about everything together.

And that's why I'll always work for Better Health Care, rural broadband, and most importantly Universal dog. Treats for all Max takes this title, very seriously, she's not kidding.

He won't even look at it you know I think everybody likes Max he's well respected within the campaign. He's he's fun. You may not be your typical senior advisor, but he's always been there for me and I've got his back. All kidding aside, we're building a movement to unseat Marjorie, Taylor green here in Georgia and our campaign is fueled by Grassroots donations like yours.

x_2849699035338759,"Soon, children you love will head back to school...  In different times, parents and grandparents used to feel a mixture of excitement, anticipation and happiness. School was where children learned about themselves, formed friendships, and of course learned about the world.  Sadly, today it‚Äôs more complicated. Schools that were once a safe haven have been infiltrated by dangerous and radical agendas that jeopardise our children's mental health, happiness and identity.   The good news is, you can do something about it. Your child might get an education in school, but his aspirations, dreams and role models can be formed at bedtime with stories that capture their heart.   Less than a year ago we launched Heroes of Liberty with our children's souls in mind. We teach American values and life lessons by example, with beautiful art and engaging stories about the life of Heroes such as Ronald Reagan, Alexander Hamilton, John Wayne, Thomas Sowell, Mark Twain, Amy Coney Barret, Rush Limbaugh and Margaret Thatcher.   Since we launched, our books have been praised on the Wall Street Journal, Fox and Friends, Megyn Kelly Show, The Daily Wire, Fox Business, Daily Caller, The Five, and in the education magazine Chalkboard Review, where former history teacher Steven Studer complained, ‚ÄúMy only issue with this series so far is the limited number of books available‚Äù.

I started a small business here, creating good jobs and opportunities for people who call this city home.   I spent seven years on the City Council, serving my community while working to make sure that our community was one where everyone could thrive.  I also represented El Paso in Congress for six years, where I fought for veterans, health care, and our public lands.   In 2018, I ran for Senate ‚Äî and our campaign made history as one of the closest elections ever in Texas. We increased young voter turnout, organized everywhere across the state, and won more votes than any Democrat running for Senate in Texas ever had. Since 2018, I‚Äôve worked with organizers across the state to register tens of thousands of eligible voters and get more people involved in our democracy.   Now, I‚Äôm running to be the next Governor of Texas and it couldn‚Äôt be happening at a more pivotal time. Our state is at a historic crossroads, and now more than ever, we need to deliver for the people of Texas ‚Äî great jobs, world-class schools, the ability to see a doctor, and the opportunity for everyone to live to their full potential.

I'm going to break down where your two candidates stand on the right to keep and bear arms. All right, so let's just jump into it. I'm Chris door with the Ohio gun owners. I'm going to break down where these two candidates to end the Republican and the Democrat. But before I do just want to mention that we can emails and phone calls from people all across the state, State who live in Suburban areas, urban areas, who are sick and tired of watching these policies. Get enacted that have been not stopping the violent crime. In fact, a lot of these people, especially the north side of Columbus are reporting to us that in the last couple of years. They've seen a massive increase in violent crime, that'll that quite frankly, the vide, the the violent criminal class, seems more emboldened than ever to carry out their their acts of violence. It's in crime. And so, Ohio, gun owners issues are candida survey, every election cycle to all the candidates running. We asked him. The tough questions that we know they're going to face if they get elected because we know like, most citizens know that that private firearms ownership when moms and dads and grandparents and uncles and workers, when they can defend themselves against violent crime. I'm it's a general deterrent on violent crime because quite frankly now violent criminals are much less prone to committing, their acts of crime, if there's the threat that they themselves can be shot. So it's not it's not rocket science, it's basic human nature, which is why you see a lot of crime happen in these gun-free zones. They target those places. Anyway, we asked both of the candidates in this District. Ismail Muhammad and Josiah Landing, where they stand on these two on these gun rights. Issues and we have reached some results that would like to report to you. First of all, Josiah Lanning this guy. Knocked it out of the park. He answered every single question.

x_443539684431702,"Big news:   Michiganders will soon have easier access to birth control‚Äîand more freedom to plan their own families‚Äîas a result of an executive directive from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.  Here‚Äôs the deal:  Before Roe v. Wade was overturned in June, Whitmer asked state departments and agencies to identify ways they could protect the reproductive freedoms of Michiganders.  This week, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs announced that pharmacists will soon be able to prescribe birth control options like oral contraceptives, the patch, and the ring. Right now, Michiganders can only get birth control from a doctor. The new program, however, allows pharmacists to partner with doctors and an oversight process to safely and conveniently prescribe birth control themselves.  Nearly 30% of women in the US say they face barriers when trying to get or refill birth control, so helping Michiganders access that key part of family planning could be a game-changer.  Pharmacists don‚Äôt have to participate. If they do, however, they‚Äôll join colleagues across the country who are part of similar programs. Michigan‚Äôs now one of 20 other states and the District of Columbia to offer the pharmacist-physician contraceptive partnership.  "". Access to. ION.

x_443609781149268,"Well, that didn‚Äôt take long. Less than an hour after I was declared the Democratic nominee for Senate in Iowa, the attacks from Chuck Grassley began.  ‚ÄúThe most liberal nominee in Iowa Senate history‚Äù ‚ÄúRadical‚Äù ‚ÄúSocialist‚Äù  Gotta love it!  Chuck Grassley doesn‚Äôt know what to say about me. He‚Äôs never faced an opponent like me before. I‚Äôm his political nightmare, so he‚Äôs just throwing cow pies at the wall and hoping something sticks.  Calling me ‚Äúradical‚Äù is laughable when Chuck Grassley supports a complete ban on abortion and letting literally anyone buy an AR-15 without even a background check. But there‚Äôs one attack that I absolutely won‚Äôt take lying down, and that‚Äôs Chuck Grassley‚Äôs attacking me for serving our country for 36 years in the U.S. Navy.  Grassley is already trying to say that because I enlisted in the military at age 19, because my deployments meant that my family had to move from state-to-state and country-to-country... that I‚Äôm not an Iowan anymore.  Chuck Grassley wants to pretend that I wasn‚Äôt raised in rural, northwest Iowa. He ignores the enormous sacrifices that my family ‚Äì my wife and my kids ‚Äì made to allow me to serve in the Navy.  Grassley‚Äôs attacks denigrate every servicemember and every military family that has to pack up, change schools, say goodbye to friends, spend holidays away from each other, and be absent from life‚Äôs big events like weddings and the birth of a child.  And if Chuck Grassley thinks that I will stand silent while he says that every Iowan who puts on our country‚Äôs uniform stops being an Iowan... he‚Äôs delusional.  These are the kinds of attacks I‚Äôm going to be up against. Nasty stuff from Chuck Grassley, Mitch McConnell, and the Fox ‚ÄòEntertainment‚Äô News propaganda network.  There‚Äôs one reason why: The GOP is scared. They‚Äôve seen the polls, and they know that if we defeat Grassley and turn Iowa blue this November, Democrats are guaranteed to maintain our Senate majority.  In order to fight back, we need to raise $250,000 before our mid-month deadline at midnight tonight, but the only way we‚Äôll hit our goal and send Grassley packing is if grassroots donors like you give right now:  Please, can I count on you to give $10 or more right now ‚Äì every dollar you can afford ‚Äì to help me defeat Chuck Grassley, turn Iowa blue, and protect our Democratic Senate majority?  These attacks against me are ridiculous, but we cannot let them go unanswered.  VICE ADMIRAL FRANKEN (RET) IS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE U.S. NAVY. USE OF HIS MILITARY RANK, JOB TITLES,.

And did so repeatedly, year after year. But finally, after learning that Americans and Iowans overwhelmingly like the health care coverage they get under the Affordable Care Act, Grassley has pledged NOT to vote to change it!

But when you break down the numbers, you see it‚Äôs just the start of a critical phase in our campaign:  Independent voters are breaking toward Demings by 13 points, 50% vs 37%. This is GREAT! But Rubio holds a significant lead in name recognition: 94% of likely general election voters know him. For a newcomer like Demings, that number is 67%.  Bottom line: When independents learn about Demings, more break her way. If we make her a household name, there‚Äôs a clear path to victory in Florida.

Salvi is a self-funder who previously bankrolled her own campaign for Congress with nearly $1.3 MILLION, so this could just be the beginning of her trying to buy this seat.   If she succeeds in buying this seat, she‚Äôll go on to help pass a total ban on abortion, even in the case of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother.  We can‚Äôt let that happen.

Then, the NRA gave her an ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating, and Drazan proudly accepted an endorsement from a group with ties to election deniers and Capitol rioters.  Now, we need to mobilize and show folks that Drazan is actively hiding her MAGA ways.  It couldn‚Äôt be more clear Christine Drazan is too right-wing for Oregon.

So before I ask you to make a donation to my campaign for U.S. Senate, let me tell you more.  On my left arm I have the zip code 15104. That‚Äôs Braddock, PA, my home and the community I was honored to serve as Mayor for 13 years. Gisele and I are raising our kids here in Braddock, right across the street from Andrew Carnegie‚Äôs first steel mill.   On my right arm I have nine different dates. These represent the dates of people who were killed through violence in Braddock while I served as mayor, starting in 2006. Seven out of nine were gun deaths.   My first tattoo came after January 16, 2006. It was my second week on the job as mayor after winning my election by a single vote. I received a call and was summoned to a police crime scene where a pizza delivery man had been robbed and killed at gunpoint.   Every time Braddock lost someone was the worst feeling in the world. In a close-knit community like Braddock, it‚Äôs very likely that you know the victim and their family. It‚Äôs an incredibly wrenching and personal experience as a mayor ‚Äî but nothing compared to what the families have to go through.  I worked with the community to take on gun violence and other important issues that Braddock faced every day. I helped initiate youth and art programs for the students of our community and we worked together to create a community center.  We also worked to develop buildings that had been written off, kick-started our economy, and reduced deadly violence. My proudest moment as Mayor of Braddock was when our community went 5 1‚ÅÑ2 years without a gun-related death.  Now I‚Äôm running for U.S. Senate, and the honest truth is that we still need to raise a lot of money to take down my self-funding opponent, Dr. Oz, and his band of celebrity grifters.

First of all, you already know, people of color, borrow more money than a little bit to try to get their way through school. And that little 20K, it ain't gonna put a dent in what we got going on. So we ask me questions like okay, how does this help the community of people who got a couple hundred K and student loans, but they only make in like 50k on their government job. So big daddy. Biden was like, stop playing with me. We thought about That this house going to work this a multi-tiered program, okay? It ain't just one step Shot. One Stop Shop, top 10 about with you good, couple of Tears. So, the first tier, that's the one we all know about 125. 250, 10 to 20 K. Boom got that, but we got to solve this situation from the bottom up. So what we got going on is we going to help the 90 percenters first, right? So most people, 90% of people and I won't get help. In this program, they make less than 75 K. We're gonna go ahead and wipe that out. Kind of like when you pay your credit card bill, right? If you go and pay the lowest bill first. So you can just Get it over with and then you start building your way up. So we covering them first, they need the most help we talked about teachers, okay? Government workers. The people that we need that day, making a little bit of money and they got a lot of bit of loans, we helping them, but even if you don't fit in that bracket, you still covered. Because what we're going to do is you don't have to make no more payments on your rooms. Until next year, we're gonna go ahead and put a hold on that. So you can go ahead and keep saving a little bit more your bread. So that when you're ready to start, making these payments again next year in 2023, you will have a little bit to the side on top of that, they learn the income based. That's from ten to five percent. So go ahead cut that in half, but you know, the real problem is that interest on the loans because them interest got us in a Chokehold like you can't even get to the premium because it just want to fight so much.

As State Representative, I continue my support for our community organizations and continue fighting for us. WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT RE-ELECT CAROL DOHERTY STATE REPRESENTATIVE DANIEL LEFEBVRE WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT RE-ELECT CAROL DOHERTY RE-ELECT STATE REPRESENTATIVE CAROL DOHERTY ANIEL LEFEBVRE STATE REPRESENTATIVE RE-ELECT CAROL DOHERTY STATE REPRESENTATIVE en RE-ELECT CAROL DOHERTY STATE REPRESENTATIVE Garden RE-ELECT CAROL DOHERTY STATE REPRESENTATIVE RE-ELECT CAROL DOHERTY STATE REPRESENTATIVE VOTE BY NOVEMBER 8TH  Hi. My name is Dan LeFevre and I am a taunting resident for the last 10 years. I know Carol Doherty from my experience with her at the Taunton Community Gardens. And I support Carol for State Legislature for legislator for many reasons. One of the things that stands out to me, the, I'm an educator by trade. And Carol has served on the Taunton school committee. For five terms, she have currently Nine Bells, but she's sponsoring the state legislature. Some of them are involving education and they are for causes that. I deeply believe in. She also supports mental health and support for people with disabilities. She's got some privacy builds in there as well and she has co-sponsored dozens and dozens of bills. So I would encourage those of you who don't know Carol to check out MMA, Richard dot-gov and take a look at Carol's record. The other reason that I also wanted to make this video was that I know that there are other people out there running for the same position. And when I've done my research on what they stand for, I'm finding a lot of generality and I'm not seeing a lot of specific information and some of the things that I'm reading from them have to do with national policies and not policies that are on the state level and Carol has experience on the state level. And again, if you look at her track record at my legislature dot-gov, you can see what she stands for and the work that you've already been doing. So as a citizen of Taunton, I'm asking you to make sure you go out and vote for Carol Doherty by November 8th.

So before I ask you to make a donation to my campaign for U.S. Senate, let me tell you more.  On my left arm I have the zip code 15104. That‚Äôs Braddock, PA, my home and the community I was honored to serve as Mayor for 13 years. Gisele and I are raising our kids here in Braddock, right across the street from Andrew Carnegie‚Äôs first steel mill.   On my right arm I have nine different dates. These represent the dates of people who were killed through violence in Braddock while I served as mayor, starting in 2006. Seven out of nine were gun deaths.   My first tattoo came after January 16, 2006. It was my second week on the job as mayor after winning my election by a single vote. I received a call and was summoned to a police crime scene where a pizza delivery man had been robbed and killed at gunpoint.   Every time Braddock lost someone was the worst feeling in the world. In a close-knit community like Braddock, it‚Äôs very likely that you know the victim and their family. It‚Äôs an incredibly wrenching and personal experience as a mayor ‚Äî but nothing compared to what the families have to go through.  I worked with the community to take on gun violence and other important issues that Braddock faced every day. I helped initiate youth and art programs for the students of our community and we worked together to create a community center.  We also worked to develop buildings that had been written off, kick-started our economy, and reduced deadly violence. My proudest moment as Mayor of Braddock was when our community went 5 1‚ÅÑ2 years without a gun-related death.  Now I‚Äôm running for U.S. Senate, and thehonest truth is that we still need to raise a lot of money to take down my self-funding opponent, Dr. Oz, and his band of celebrity grifters.

It actually, well, it depends, it depends upon if we're talking about infrastructure and brick and mortar projects and certainly Alaska is a very young State on Congressman young. The late young, my predecessor had always been a very strong proponent and advocate for infrastructure. We need deep. Sea ports on the western coast of Alaska. We need military installations that we had never considered. Because, you know, you just had the clip about the southern border. We're very worried about our most western border, along the Bering Sea. We've had folks, from Russia, come across already. There were two gentlemen, who were trying to evade their inscription?

My son managed to escape from his abductor. My daughter was reported in missing person. We contacted law enforcement and since they didn't have the tools available at the time, we had a hard time searching for her. They found her but she was murdered. Just the pain of missing her and not having her here today with us. It hurts so much if Amber Alert had been on Indian Country. It might have alerted someone who had seen some evidence and maybe we could have saved that life and we know that lives have been saved with Amber Alert when your child is. Missing and you find out that there are the tools available for your law enforcement to look for your child. It brings with it so much heartache and anguish.

Some are pointing out the irony that the state is asking residents to not charge electric vehicles during these Flex alerts. While just last week, California made headlines, for proving that first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas cars by 2035. Senator Brian. And Ali is here now to give us his reaction to all of what's going on with the electric grid and someone and so much more going to see a state. Senator, how are you thanks for having me? You know, Governor Gavin Newsom is Where'd that we should turn back on the Diablo. Canyon obviously there are, there are tens there a lot of generation plants in my district that are shut down but he wants California to not charge their car. That's the one place you can go today and actually turn your car. If you have a gas vehicle and get cooled down and turn your air conditioner on in your car. So I think the his plan is a very flawed as we know and he's a failure in this area we need a grid that is sustainable, there are grid that can we can move power around California, we can do that if we have the right policy makers in Sacramento doing those a lot. The same boy. We've got that. I mean, we're in such a great time with with space travel and cell phones. And and now he can't wash our clothes between these certain times because the the electric grid, what needs to happen to our grid in order for these Flex alerts, not to happen. And maybe, you know, to do away with these rolling brownouts and blackouts. Well, the biggest problem we have is we can't get the power in California from one place to the other. We have a, we have a lot of power that's available in some areas, but the transmission system is not up to date. We've I've seen that happen in the past. We've had rolling BRAC blackouts and the governor has failed in this area. He has not adequately secured the power that we need. They're shutting down power plants, just last week and session, the state, senate, extended gas-fired power plants, so that we can we knew this heat wave was coming. But overall, we need to secure long-term power, it's available in California and we should be able to do that without having to have these Flex alerts. If it was done properly secure that long-term, Senator Brian Dahle Brian Dahle for Governor 2022 briandahle.com  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This isn't the kind of offer that happens every day, but it‚Äôs happening because the stakes of Catherine's race couldn‚Äôt be higher. CNN and The New York Times just named Catherine the most vulnerable senator in the entire country, and polling shows her trailing her extremist opponent by a single point.

The Washington Post just reported that Catherine is the GOP‚Äôs #1 target, which explains the tens of millions of dollars they‚Äôre spending on attack ads to defeat her.

For people on Medicare, it caps out-of-pocket prescription drug costs ‚Äì including an insulin cap at $35/month ‚Äì and stops big pharma from jacking up prices on drugs.

But I wanted to take a moment to tell you how I‚Äôve prepared for big hearings and big moments during my time in Congress.  You might remember a few years ago when I was in the middle of impeachment hearings for President Donald Trump. Well, I wanted to take you inside what it‚Äôs like.  Every Member prepares differently, but I start by reviewing the evidence. That means reading transcripts of interviews and depositions ‚Äî often hundreds or thousands of pages ‚Äî watching video evidence, listening to recordings, and reviewing exhibits.   My next step is to outline. What are my objectives? What evidence am I hoping to highlight? What moments are most important for the public to see?  And then, I write. I write a lot. I think it‚Äôs important to write and speak in my own voice. That‚Äôs what people expect.  After all of that, I prepare with staff. Again, a lot. We go over the videos and evidence. And then do it again. And again.  Then, when the hearing begins, I set all that preparation aside and listen to what the witnesses have to say, looking for something unique, a new insight that I can draw upon in follow-up questions. I try not to be so wedded to a script that I miss what is truly important. You would be surprised how often that happens.  It‚Äôs long and arduous work. But it‚Äôs worth it. Because hopefully, the end result is something that really connects with the American people, and is deeply meaningful.  So, as I begin a busy month in DC, I hope that I can continue to convince people of the same things that I have always thought were important: That what is right still matters. That the truth matters. And that decency matters.  Because it does. And it always will. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking for a donation, so I can focus on the work at hand, protecting our democracy.

Let‚Äôs talk about ads run by outside groups: this is where I‚Äôm getting clobbered. Republican groups have spent nearly $7 million on TV ads attacking me, and this race has one of the biggest deficits between what Republican and Democrat groups are spending in a race with an incumbent House Democrat.  Because my campaign doesn‚Äôt take corporate PAC money, our ads are truly funded by grassroots supporters. In such a competitive district like this one, I‚Äôm proud that we‚Äôre able to run TV and digital ads‚Äìthanks to you!  The math is clear. The only reason I‚Äôm able to compete with these dark money groups is because of supporters like you chipping in. Our average donation this week is $24. Can you contribute $24 today?

We‚Äôve done something we‚Äôve never done in our 23-year history: We‚Äôre running a multimillion-dollar campaign to stop Donald Trump from replacing the top election officials in battleground states with his loyalists in this November‚Äôs midterm elections‚Äîand this has sent Fox News and the Republican Party scrambling.   ""Sometimes the vote counter is more important than the candidate,"" Trump stated at a rally this year. That explains Trump‚Äôs plan for the 2024 election‚Äîand if it works, the voters will not decide the election‚Äôs outcome.   The upcoming midterm elections are a critical time for Trump and his allies to are methodically working to place Trump's most ardent supporters‚Äîall who spout his Big Lie of a stolen election‚Äîin secretary of state offices of battleground states. In most states, secretaries of state oversee vote counting, have the power to certify (or decertify!) election results, and declare election winners and losers.  That‚Äôs why MoveOn‚Äôs all-out work to fight Trump‚Äôs efforts this November and protect our elections has hit a nerve with Fox News and the GOP. A GOP spokesperson responded to MoveOn's campaign by saying the GOP will ""accelerate our fundraising efforts so we can stop them.""  This is worrying: If we allow Republicans, their billionaire donors, and dark-money groups to steamroll our efforts with their fundraising, Trump's plot to use secretaries of state to install him to another term as president might just work.

Maria is spreading in her tv ads about me and my position on abortion. It's really no surprise that she's resorted to this because she's been lying to the voters of the second district for four years. Now, she says, she's a moderate. If she votes with Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden's extreme policies, Almost, 100% of the time she lies about my position on abortion because she doesn't want to talk about all the things that this election should be about, like inflation, the high cost of gas and groceries. Crime and education Elaine, has to lie about my views on abortion to deflect from her own policy position, which is Extreme. She is actually voted on the US House floor in favor of abortions at any time. Even up to nine months for any reason and at taxpayer expense, which is so out of touch with this District, to be very clear and unambiguous about my position on abortion. I've always been an advocate for women to choose life. But for allowing, for exceptions, in cases of rape, incest, and life of the mother, I'm a nurse who listens and I'm a mother who cares?

x_823660798763677,"WHY IS COMMISSIONER SANDY FLOWERS SO MAD?  Well, as I previously posted, I came to the Port Commission newly elected in 2018 and found that the Chairman did not live here.(see previous post). Realizing that our Republic had literally been hijacked by this interloper and no help in sight, I continued on to some more of this.....  I posted my public official bond of $5k as required by the Port charter which was issued to me at my first meeting. The Charter also required the Port secretary to reimburse me the cost of the bond which was $340. Instead, the other Port Commissioners, Way, Brown and Rivers, took a vote to keep my money.  The Charter also dictated that any commissioner who did not get their public official bond ""shall vacate their office"". When I advised them all of the charter's demand, they scoffed and refused to comply with the law. Commissioner West was not on the board at this time.  Right after that, it became apparent that the $2.9 dollar dredge contract at Summer Haven was woefully incomplete. Long story short, there was no bid on a $376 thousand dollar engineering contract, it was given away. The subcontractor came to the job without state required insurance. Just to mention a few. It's just a few chips off the iceberg in the Summer Haven catastrophy. End of the day, false statements were made, the project was unfinished and the lack of oversight cost the tax payers $978K in FEMA grant money ($886k + $92k)   The contractors were liable, I called an emergency meeting and asked the other Commissioners to file a claim to recoup the tax payer's dollar which had been illegally squandered. All commissioners voted yea. Ultimately they all back peddled from this action and did nothing. I complained bitterly for two years about following that public mandate, to no avail.   There is a Pat Conroy novel here that could explain all of politics in Florida. Glad to discuss it in more detail with anyone.   Needless to say, you don't talk about 32 year long engineering contracts and projects that are never completed but paid in full without expecting some backlash.  The backlash came in the form of character defamation and collusion between the Port Attorney, Clay Meek (specially chosen to get rid of me) and the Director of General services for City of St Augustine, Jim Piggott.   Again, the story is too long, but in a nutshell, the two of them and a few others, pulled off a smear campaign against me.    The Port Attorney used a hand written piece a notebook paper, sent to the Port anonymously ,no official anything to even indicate that it came from the City or it's police department, to place an item on the Port agenda to discuss the possibility of filing a complaint with the Florida Ethics Commission against me for using a racial slur.    The fact is, however, that the racial slur never happened and the Ethics Commission told me directly that they would reject any complaint based on such a claim. They informed me that they are not the morality police and have a very narrow scope of interest which is primarily concerned with funneling money into the pockets of your family and businesses that you profit from. So any attorney worth their salt would certainly be able to tell the difference in what is a Ethics complaint and what is not an Ethics complaint.    But Port attorney Meek was not really interested in his complaint being rejected. He and Mr. Piggott were out for me. Turns out, Jim Piggott was the only one who took receipt of that fictitious, anonymous police report. I interviewed Chief Fox and his records department carefully to obtain this data.  Did I mention, the Port Attorney did all of this before he even bothered to sign his contract with the Port. When I asked him who advised him to waste tax payer's dollars on a project without board approval, he told me "" Chairman Brown"" told him to do it.  Alrighty then, wish I had never voted for Chairman Matt Brown or campaigned for him or nominated him as chairman. Good ole boy crosses all party lines. Another book here all by itself but I invite you to view their handiwork in the St Augustine record at https://www.staugustine.com/story/news/2020/10/23/allegations-against-port-waterway-commissioner-prompt-ethics-question/3720327001/  Needless to say, they didn't expect me to defend myself. I am from South Carolina. They should have known better.  Follow up post on its way! I have a lot more to say! This is why I am running again with folks that I know have solid common sense and direct knowledge of Port operations.....Melanie Sunshine Neal and Michelle Bennett. My hands are tied without a quorum of common sense.  Disclaimer:. Commissioner West missed much of this fun . Hopefully we can all move forward fully informed about the past actions of the St Augustine Port ,Waterways & Beach Commission.   Happy posts coming up next, so we don't all get depressed.

That all this climate change stuff is supposed to be doing and it's not doing its driving up the cost of everything that we do and we're competing against other states and other nations. You don't know anything about farming. I'mma tell you that right now and you don't know much about the force but you're all been educated by somebody who hasn't lived out there and done it. I'm sorry I'm I can't believe how long are we going to just continue to set targets with no good detail and just throw money at it and get no result? The governor put a billion and a half dollars in the forest whoop-dee-doo, we treated 60,000 Acres. The private people. The people that actually own Force land treated at half a million acres. And you know what? The natural resources agency counted that and their treatment, they didn't spend one cent on it. They actually paid money to the Natural Resources agency to do the work on their own lands. They were taxed in. This is a joke. This is a total joke. If you want to keep farmers in California, leave us the hell alone. Let us produce a product and feed America. We do a good job of it. I mean, That's another goal. We just had the mayor Sushi bill, which was a goal. We've had all these goals and what are we getting for? Million acre fire, Dixie fire, and the last 10 years, since I've been here, we've set goals. And I've stood up and I said that's a goal. But how you going to get there again? We throw money at it. Californians, taxpayer money, and carbon money. My good friend from Fremont talks about the auction that just went off the other day and we almost created a billion dollars where the billion dollars come from does anybody know?

It will happen again.  In fact, it's already happening in slow motion right in front of us, with Trump's election deniers running to take over the offices that count votes and will certify the results of the 2024 election. Some dangerous examples:  In Arizona, the GOP candidate for secretary of state is Mark Finchem, a QAnon-supporting member of the white supremacist Oath Keepers militia, who participated in the January 6 insurrection. He won the GOP primary by claiming that Trump won the 2020 election.  In Michigan, the GOP candidate for secretary of state is Big Lie proponent Kristina Karamo, who rose to conservative prominence after falsely claiming to have witnessed election fraud as a pollster.  There are many more Big Liars running to control our elections‚Äîand they terrify me. If any one of them wins in a battleground state, they could tip the balance to Trump in a tight presidential election. What terrifies me even more is that they could tip America away from democracy to authoritarianism.  MoveOn has a long track record of turning out voters, and I'm so impressed by their focus on these secretary of state races.

The state budget we passed in June included $600 million for nursing homes with 70% of it going to staffing and resident care, but 14 facilities are still without contracts, which is unacceptable.

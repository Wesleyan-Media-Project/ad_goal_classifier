When you look at me. You are really looking at a piece of yourself. I truly am. One of you. I've been through much of what you've experienced in your life. I've had the joys and Sorrows, I've lost them. People that were important to me. I've been unemployed for 8 to 10 months during the 2008 crisis. I work in corporate jobs. I own my own business. I started it from scratch so I can relate and have empathy for most people here in Wisconsin, but most importantly through this journey. I took the time to figure out what it really will take to make this day. A wonderful place to live for all. Yeah. We keep blaming a party instead of the corrupt and failed structure of the system that we all operate beneath. I'm not referring to the Constitution, but rather the rosian of it over.Time. I'm here to create and develop a new system that will benefit all who are willing to contribute their talents and produce. That's the key thing. I personally did not come from privileged. I was not born into an elitist family, or positions of Power are expected rather than working to serve the common. Good of the citizen right now. The people in Wisconsin are suffering. They have feelings of hopelessness and not sure of the future. You don't need a short few months their entire world got turned upside down.What we really need is not two parties blaming each other. All right, we don't need politicians pointing fingers and you know, saying we can't do the right thing because if my, you know, the election cycle and I might risk losing my position. We need to put all that behind us and we need to start doing what's right for the people right now. No matter what, I go back to the famous words of John F, Kennedy where he said, ask not what your country can do for you to ask what you can do for your country, you know, too many people. We've been trained and fortunately to look to this entity of government that has all the answers somehow, and it's meant to solve all the problems and it can you give us free this and free? That I'mma tell you right now people that is an illusion. That is a lie. Most importantly that is a trap. That'll leave you at the end destitute hungry and poor. What is time to do now is for everyone to take individual responsibility for their own lives for more importantly.I'll have to recognize that it is a broken and failed system that is keeping us in this state of decay and there are people in power that want the system to remain because in doing. So it will keep extracting your life force out of you last drop of money. Your last little bit of you know, bloody ends up to the very top. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is fact, if you to the research, this is fact and can be proven time and time again, the multinational corporations hand-in-hand with central banks in the Federal Reserve and the government working all together in conjunction have created this monstrosity, this huge monster that is just pressing you the people while you are out of work, but you got your musically. One little stimulus, check of $2,400. There is corporations getting to the billion.I'm feeling the dollar with a click of a mouse. The central bank can create really into new digital currency and give it to whoever they want by whatever they want. But you can't do that thing for you, the people to wake up and learn learn. What's really keeping you down there in the solution to all this. I beg of you. Please come along on this journey and educate yourself to understand why nothing really changed your taxes, maybe get caught a little bit here and there and some nice things in a politician will throw you a bone, but does your life really changed? Does it really get better? Be honest with yourself? I asked you take a hard. Look. Is your life actually getting better. Has it gotten better over the last 10, 25, 30 years or has it slowly degraded. I'm willing to bet for the majority of you is slowly to created.I truly believe this is our one opportunity here in Wisconsin to first of all, right, all the wrongs that Tony eavers had done and to unite everyone. Write the people that are willing to come together. There's so much division separation between even Republicans and Democrats and no one's really thinking clearly anymore. My father said something interesting. He said, Jonathan instead of a mask mandate you command a common sense. And I had to laugh at that because we are lacking Common Sense on both sides of the aisle and it's something that I truly been blessed with two. Always maintained is a sense of Common Sense throughout my life. I mean, I have all the answers, you know why? I talked to many smart and supporters. Many people who message me my campaign page and I realized I don't have all the answers, but what I do know, if together we can figure out a better solution for our state than what we have right now. If you agree with what I'm saying, if it resonates with you, they keep telling my story. Keep sharing it with other people. I know all of you are great as sharing my content. Share this podcast.But this is just a short reason why I believe you should vote for me. Because together we're going to create something wonderful that we all want to be a part of. So the action I want you to take is keep asking the why questions never stopped Deep dive into the structure of the system as it currently stands today. And ask yourself. Should it be that way the benefit to you? If you will be part of the change? The real changed to bring about complete freedom and prosperity for All?

I'm a successful small business owner and have a sound understanding of economic principles that benefit the working class. Get to know me and what I stand for inside this audio interview.  Okay, Patrick. Do I have permission to record this call? Yes, you do. Looks like you were looking at running has recall effort, correct? So I am a finance economic. I also have to do some trading on Wall Street. A lot different contacts within many different Industries and I've been following politics for the last ten years and I didn't like, what I was seeing coming down the Horizon. And I also didn't really wasn't comfortable with the leadership currently that I saw cute up for the GOP. Neither side, really Republican or Democrat, and I really care about my state. It's, it's home to me. I love it. And the people are great and they just don't deserve, you know, this terrible leadership that we have and all the suffering. He knows everyone's going through, especially now. And so, I know, you know, I, I, I feel, I had a strategy on the right plan to get us back on our feet and moving again. And that's why I stepped in the race. Correct. unsatisfied with the current leadership, we have Like specifically would you like to see the Constitution? How there's a lot of advice, but first of all, first one would be the excessive lockdowns. I had a real problem with that. I believe that each individual adult should be able to decide how they want to do, you know, protect themselves and their health, not have the government mandate to them, what they can and cannot do. And I understand that we were under the pretense of a global pandemic, which we are now realizing that actually wasn't the case. And I don't really want to have to pay too much about that. But my sources have showed early on that. The severity of covid-19 was not as high of a threat level, as a mainstream media outlets for train it to be. So, how was fine with the initial two-week? Lockdown was kind of see what's going on. But after that, and started ragging on, I realized that there was something more nefarious to it, and it felt like the policy that one place were really benefiting the multinational, big corporations, your Amazon, your Walmart, but is very strict on the small and medium-sized business owner. They had to really shut down for the whole Thanks, and I was really kind of yellow top of my lungs. Like if we hold any longer. We're going to lose a lot of bit small business and a lot of jobs and a lot of livelihoods are going to be destroyed and I didn't think I didn't think the risk in all risk reward ratio there from locking down to how many people are going to lose income then maybe their homes with was a good trade-off. So I said it's time to open up the economy housing as and within the mist of the crisis. So I was actually leading out early on with in it even though you know, I wasn't even you know, quite a Kennedy. I was already thinking about it. I start speaking on my Facebook and that's how I was some people started following me. Given your views on the shutdown. What do you think of the right? So, that was the next one? I was, I've been a poet. I've been opposed to the mask mandate from from day one. And again, I understand that if you own a private business, it is your choice. I know how you want to operate that, but I am doing some hunting. I realized there wasn't really a business owners Choice with the mask mandate Department of Health, and the man and them, you know, the decree, if you will come in from ebers, that was leveraging their business license. And so they don't want to lose their business license and get shut down by the government. Therefore, they were forced to comply and the other thing and I really didn't like, was that business owners and their staff had to cut up, start policing the customers themselves, you know, it's kind of relationship in a way from customers that didn't want to wear a mask from the place that they like to go and frequent do business. They want to support that business place, but now, it's just something they couldn't do, you know, so even myself. I don't, I don't wear a mask. I haven't wore masks from day one. Unfortunately, I have not been able to go to all the businesses and restaurants that I used to love going to because of that. Why did you decide not to do it? Sure, there's there's many reasons, but the main one is, I believe and the immune system, the god designed Us in his infinite wisdom and we have a powerful immune system. I felt there wasn't enough attention going into. How do we, how do you boost your immune system to protect from this virus? And we just all this emphasis was placed on this mask and it was the first was in the right kind of mask, you know, and if people were just throwing anything around their face thinking that they were protecting themselves and others and it's just getting ridiculous. And so, at some point I realized that this was kind of like the emperor has no clothes moment, you know, and then you go into somebody stores and even the gym. Now you see these people and they got it down by their chin and it's like does a virus really wait for you know, you're at your mass to be down before it comes out. I mean, you know, we have it there knows if both are not even wearing a properly so it's not doing anyone. Any good. So, you know, the virus is still being spread fear ready? Right. So what is this whole Mass nonsense then why they keep forcing this issue. What's happening covid-19? It was, it was inaccurate to to declare a global pandemic. I have a few items. I'm sure you've checked out. My my YouTube video channel. I have a lot of video education material that I put out there and explain how, you know, my reasons for everything. But listen to people who are at high risk, for always going to be at risk of catching something the elderly, write the immunocompromised. I did. I am totally on board hate. If they want to go ahead and sit and self quarantine and isolate and do what I need to do to protect themself. I'm all for it. But to shut down, you know, the other 96, 97 per-cent of the population, just didn't make any sense to me. So again, it felt very much like a top again. Then we saw dr. Fauci. And all the inconsistencies that we're coming out from the onow, a hand with the CDC and in the who he was all over the place, you know, it's so if this is government and they're supposed to be the expert, So smart and letting us know what to do. Well in my opinion they got an upgrade on this whole thing. The recall the governor and have you been involved at all? And I'm not been involved in the effort for the recall know it took me by surprise. I also did a video on my response to that. I was calling, you know personally before I was in a kind of like we need to recall 2020 either cuz I just I think is in way over his head. He is definitely not a leader. We we saw that with the whole Kenosha incident. So yeah, I don't think he's a good leader, especially now and when all the challenges that we have to deal with from job loss of jobs, write a high unemployment, the economy, but he's not a businessman. So doesn't understand. Don't think he's ever created one job in his life. So he's not going to know how to help dig Wisconsin out of this deep hole. Find you or did you think of the recall effort? I think there's a I think a lot of people are doing the recall because I am a candidate. Honestly, I think there's a lot of people that I have been dissatisfied with the in action from the Republican party. I know from my own podcast and the following and they're in the radio interviews. I think probably half a million people know who I am now in the state of Wisconsin based on my at my estimates, you know, I think they're excited about who I am and no, other candidate has laid out a detailed plan it before all the public to see it looks like like I said before, I bring em about transparency and of course, I'm a technology guy, I think government you, so you can go get upgraded in the 21st century here. With the way we're running at the infant, you know, is so inefficient and there's so there's really had to take time out on your own. Watch there and go check out my Wisconsin voice app technology videos. I think it would be pretty impressed with what I'm trying to do because I'm trying to get big money out of politics. So it's fair for people who want to come in a coming from a position. They have the best ideas, not just how much money they can spend on advertisements. And I know this was a big issue with the recall where they're saying. Oh, well, Tony Burton reads on limited funds. I say, who cares? Who cares? If him and Joe, Biden spent 50 million dollars in, advertisements. If you've already made up your mind that he's done a terrible job and he has not protected the people, Wisconsin. You're not going to vote for him because you're seeing is add 100 times a day. I have and you know, I'm here to bring peace to the state under a peaceful guy. Even though I've done martial arts for 12 years. I've never engaged in one fight because my scent they told me that the moment you fight you've lost because you should be able to settle any dispute with your words, right? And so I'm from the small short video clip that I did see. And that's the problem with mainstream media and everyone has Neil cell phone cameras now, so if someone takes a video of this and that's just one perspective that we get. Unfortunately. The mainstream media takes it and they run with it and then everyone just, you know, looks at that video and assume that's exactly how it played out. I am fully back the badge and law enforcement. Can we improve our processes shark should come out Kenosha officers. It had the body cameras. Yes, I think so. I think we're leaving a day and age would like, like I said, how many smart phones are out there? The police need to always have a body cam on down there person, you know. That's just standard. Now. I don't think we can get away from that but no, it and regards to dict. He should have complied and and just go along with what the office requested him to do. There's that we don't have a complete picture. I agree. We just have that 20 when you have a couple videos from somewhere. Yeah, I mean, that's that's up to the jury to decide. I mean, you know, in the end of testimonies of the officers, right? That's the problem again, is we, we know the media gives us that and we become to judge, you know, during execution of a person, whether they're guilty or innocent. And I don't think that's, that's right, and I don't know how this country was set up. Did you think of that and the police respond to the governor's response to it? Won't we got a first talked about what it means to protest cuz I think I have a very different definition of that word during the excessive lockdown to and I personally went and protested in Brookfield Wisconsin peacefully were on the sidewalks with all their signs. We were and we did not like the excessive lockdown 2020 vs doing that. But you know, the cops were there, their they're coming by, we're waving out of them and no trouble, not one incident, right? So what happened in Kenosha, you know, and I want them all together. I understand there are people that are they protesting, and what they want. They want you no justice at Justice and fairness and face their tiresome people get killed. I understand. I don't want that either, but unfortunately, the media doesn't focus on those p. The protest. The only focus on an amp up, the ones that are destroying property and lighting building's on fire. Right? So the other thing is to It really it was right. Right. Exactly. As we now know, a lot of these people are actually not from actually with in Kenosha. They're from out of state or you know, different parts of the state, right. So their pocket or so they come in and he started to start things up and people assume. That's really the, you know, how how the people of Kenosha responding to an event and that's not really the case at all. The police officers, boy, you know, they got overwhelmed there and they definitely need a backup from a National Guard. And with a big problem. I had to think we're 20 verse really suck himself as the pr statement that he put out so quickly after the incident, it felt like he was Riley things up, and almost was on the side of the, the looters, right? Of the vandalism, and all the burning. So so that was not, that was not smart. That's not, that's not good leadership there. But then again, he delayed and dragged us video for another day or so. Before finally Brian Style. The president was able to get us more National Guard resources there. Guide. You know, again, I don't I don't really like to comment on something that I don't have all the details to. I don't want him to be swayed by my opinion on this, right? But you know from what I can tell her what I've heard is he technically live out of state? I wasn't even sure if his family or them had property or business in out in Kenosha. Maybe you can tell me whatever, you know if they had. Okay. Yeah. So here's what's happening is enough again. I personally, I don't think you should have been there at all in the first place. I will need to let the other trained professionals and law enforcement, you know, handle these situations. I'm there so much legality that goes into this, you know, if somebody was to get hurt or shot, you know what that is citizen, don't have the same kind of protection. So, you know, by the same time and I know what you were feeling like, hey, there's not enough resources, being allocated here to protect our property and our buildings. We had just made me start taking things into her own hands and didn't defend it, you know, and that's where that's kind of the boiling point that we're getting to that. So dangerous and a good leader, would be able to deescalate this and bring a peaceful resolution to it instead of people real Lock and Load. And he know their home guns and before, you know, it might just be in a civil war, right? And everyone shooting everyone, and I don't think anyone wants that to happen. What's the time in touch with you yesterday. I think President Trump came because he actually cared and Joe Biden's doing it. Because, well, he has to know the political issue, right? I was very impressed with the press conference that that person. And, yeah, I think it was. I think it's, it's handled exactly how it should handle. Just a little too late, unfortunately, and that's all the blame again on 20 years for them. Most policies. I am. I'm just waiting for him to figure out how to rein in the Federal Reserve in Central Banking. Because that's actually the pillar that's going to damage the most people, the most Americans with it within the country due to the excessive printing of money. Yeah, it does to me. You know what I'd like. I said, I, I watched it for many years and I I feel both parties are kind of guilty of things in their own ways. And I think with Republican party is, is there just a little bit stagnant right there. A little little stale their, their, their, their family to move, you know, Blitzen. If a Republican party supposed to be on the side of the Constitution. Then like I said in my recall video, you know, there's a timer in place and he is doing things that is clearly anti-American and unconstitutional, right? Then we need to check them. When you take me to get rid of them. They're no good. Time in the Republic, guys are all wait, two years and then we'll see what happens. We will wait and see what's what happens. No, no, no, no. No. That kind of apathy has brought the country to where it is today. So that's that's my take on it. Yeah, the reason for that type of leaf is like a, like a sad young peace. Party is a machine and there's Milly multi millions of dollars that flow through it, and there is an inside club, right? So for some people within it, they have the wink and Nod that it's their turn to become governor because they did their time and, you know, whatever the name I ask them. So, when else are like me, who comes in with some fresh ideas, powerful ideas, actually and looks to shake things up. Really like that so much. I don't, I don't know. I have my own suspicions, but I can't say any until it's neon. They declare. So what do you do? Unless there's some kind of misconduct. What you share that to you that because you be used sparingly. I think that you were sick. Yeah, I believe we have misconduct this time and and if people real people lost their lives under this current recall, an Endeavor, right? I wouldn't, I'm not aware of anyone dying under the last recall, for the last recall from me. Do my research understanding was really based on some some balanced budget issues, right? We had some stomach. Yep unions. So yeah, so it was very different scenario here. See what I did wrong to Warrant that. So he wanted to balance the state budget. And this is the individuals were required to balance out our own budgets. Right? We don't get off the hook for that. But for some reason governments don't have to do that. They can spend, you know, forever and ever and ever. And Walker was finally at, you know, someone that's okay. And not feel that we have to balance the budget and he hadn't had to make the tough choices to do so and that's what he did. Social Security. Yeah, there's a lot of people ask my opinion on that and so it like you said, that is a federal program. So that was just more of an educational video. Nothing. I should really have any control over but I put it out there for people to understand why a social security is in trouble. Why is already been depleted and how much is going to be a further burden on the younger generation. If we keep the program that exact same way it is today. It's the point that I want to do. By this weekend, it's been. Okay. That's great. I appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time. All right. Take care of Patrick.

The black lives matter organization. Yeah, this is Adam galette with accuracy and media and we have one heck of a story for you today black lives matter. We've been talking about it all summer all fall. It's one of the biggest topics that people are discussing. Here's another one that people are often discussing this time of year two-faced politicians. Let me tell you about Iowa Senate candidate Teresa Greenfield she's running for It helping Chuck Schumer take back the senate in an incredibly conservative State. Now this puts her in a tricky position and she has to be publicly a moderate even if privately she has to be a bit more Progressive. And where does that leave her with black lives matter? Well black lives matter is incredibly unpopular in Iowa. Not only because of the violence that occurred there over the summer, but because one of their leaders has recently been charged with nine additional felony charges amongst other things. He allegedly was planning.  NG to shut down a highway put nails on the highway and staged a hostage situation to distract police from the violence. They planned elsewhere. This is not a non-violent well-intentioned reasonable individual who seeks to get reasonable reforms like ending chokeholds and demilitarizing the police. This is a radical violent organization. Now, what is Greenfield do she can't publicly support such an unpopular organization in Iowa if she wants to win, but privately she  To appease her Progressive base. So we went undercover and asked her husband what Teresa Greenfield really thinks about black lives matter, but she supports black lives matter, right? That's great. Great. She's okay. She's down with the with black lives matter fact, we've done an awful lot to try to connect and Teresa particular has been working with all the black leaders and in Des Moines and Cedar Rapids and Iowa City how and of course the Republicans were using them on order thing and we know about  Oh about that bullshit right now. I know what you're thinking Adam. That's just her husband. What does he really know about politics? What does he really know about his wife's political stances. In fact, he's a former communications director for a Democrat Congressman. So we knows politics and he knows Communications and according to him. He knows that Theresa Greenfield supports black lives matter and you might say maybe she just supports the Grassroots movement.

Well, we went to Theresa Greenfield directly and asked her what she really thinks about black lives matter and the black lives matter organization. We were reading through the website and she was wondering why the words black lives mattered don't appear on the website. Yeah. I don't know that there's any freezing it doesn't appear on the website. So let me take a look at it. Okay, because I talk about it all the time and you support the black lives matter organization. Yeah. It's like I just did a I just did a video it should be  up on my site and my sight now but we give a shout out to both the black legislative caucus for the more perfect union law and a black life matters and the activists. Well there you have it.

Brown's involvement continues. He has brought growth, harmony and wise budgeting to our community.  Finally, Brown's business mind, caring attitude and involvement leads to harmonious solutions.

The GOP also intends to spend at least $20 million on nefarious lawsuits designed to suppress the vote this fall.

As I discussed during the forum, there is no one easy answer, instead it will require a multi-pronged approach that improves our business climate overall.  You can watch the full forum here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNMVkajtBik&app=desktop  I can read the question again, but I will start with benefits for 29, Stephanie Anderson. Hi, can you hear me to read the question again, or a question on the question of the state do to help new businesses and existing businesses? Keep their doors open as the economy. Get begins to recover. Okay. This is a, this has a multi-faceted answer. I admired you. The first thing is over all we need a more business-friendly environment. Whitney, the state government that understands that business is put the health and safety. I'll get Workforce and their customers in the Forefront of their decision-making. That's number one. We need to prioritize people. We need to help people retain their jobs and or return to the workforce. The unskilled, and the low-paid have suffered more than most in this pandemic. So, we need to increase job training. One idea would be instead of payouts to stay home. We could use that funding for tuition and job training. I've got a minute left. So I'm going to get to know, not to raise taxes. I mean, the things that have been on the table in Augusta, with the democratic government, have been to increase the gas tax to increase heating fuel by 40 cents a gallon, and to increase the income tax on wealthy people, which in the case of the legislation, two years ago, with a couple making over $120,000 a year. Those are unacceptable in terms of strategies to grow the economy. Another thing we need to do. To keep the economy growing. Its we need an adequately funded police force a law enforcement agency, to answer the call when businesses call for shoplifting burglary employee theft piece in the neighborhoods, Etc.

Hope you having a great day. I just wanted to take a minute to address my opponent that everyone yesterday. You didn't respond to Taylor that I sent out last week. The front looks like this is for page.Information in my brochure. And I think I wanted to bring this up because I spent a long time, putting this piece together for everyone in our community, candidates stand for and a lot of times they say, on the news articles in the laws and keep track of all of the different legislative session.Formation address. Each of these claims. Chris is saying that I put an information that is that Chris is saying is false, is that he has passed bills, that allows Sanders to be released within hours.However, I have this news article here and all of these news articles on bills as a reference. In my peace are all located on my website. A marshall number for Hawaii, referencing. You don't have to believe it. I know something they be surprising true. I just wanted to talk about the first one. This news article 2nd. It says, hockey the president of a local Trade Organization.Says that the offender is caught and released for tenders, especially career criminals and a loss for Crime Victims. Also the article says that's men retailers testified against the reforms and on the front of this bill Chrisley's. Also quoted, he sings Criminal Justice Reform through scene and a generation and a further. One of the last one I wanted toReference is that he says that I'm suggesting he's responsible for the release of prisoners during covid and I'm not in my teeth that he's responsible. I'm a great point that the release of prisoners and the rear rest during criminals is his thing. We can see that by many bills that he is introduced and voted for I really think criminals is not a good idea and it goes against Public Safety in our community. And the crime rate has been a source of the violent crime rate. In our district has been increasing during covid-19 covid and people Also, going to the second one. The second one is about 10 ft in the ocean in Waimanalo. What's another quote from Chip? Fletcher is saying that my quote is misleading, that's a chip Fletcher said and I just want to point out the news article that I have on my website for this to reference Bill and mm. Let's see. It's a very well-researched articles, 20 pages and on the 6th page chips Fletcher, speaking about this property. And he says that this Waimanalo property was a good example of a residential lot. That is no longer fit for habitation and geologist chip, Fletcher goes on to say and warning the public about climate change and professing to Value peaches. And on the other hand, allowing major Renovations that was on its way out and these are chips letters word. And that you can read it on my website. You don't have to take my word for it at all. And then we'll go on to the third. One. Chris's play me that he would never introduced a bill like this. That would give and support giving more money back to the residents oppose eliminating. Excuse me, safety net programs. I have this article here also available my website and is it's funny. He said he would never introduced the bill like that because here's a bell HDR. 89 It's I'm also referenced in the in this article and there's actually a link. You can click on. If you go online. You can click it on, on my website, the article, open it up and click on the bill. I think right here. I think I'll to have it land separately as well. My reference points section, but right before the bells traditional safety tests, such as welfare food stamps, and housing assistance can make government expenses, skyrocketed, basic income, could be a policy that is cheaper to implement in the long run for all Representatives Hawaii. And that's how he get the money. He'd have to eliminate. The traditional safety nets. Tell him saying that he would never do that. Was this debunked? Inglot stay. So next one is the fourth one down to 85 and has to do with the police Reform Bill. And he's saying that it had public testimony, but this bill that was passed did not have public testimony. Steve Christley off the shelf that was shelved last year. He grabbed it off this year. He took it off, they call it got Twisted through without giving the public, an opportunity to testify on the amended. Totally rewarded version. And you know why? I know this is because residents, you guys from the community were calling me when I started running. Cuz this happened recently during covid. He did this and dumb. You guys were upset because you wanted to testify. You weren't happy with it. And he's saying that it's for police misconduct, but the people in the bill that people are upset with is that administrate is Administrative issues. With the police are going to be publicized if they are late for Port lathe. If they have an accusation made against them before, it's even proven true. So that will be made public record. Now, a way to prosecute, it's like anyone else that commits a crime they are prosecuted. They go through Grievances and they get a fair hearing and, you know, they have so, That's that's actually how I found out about a lot of these bills. A lot of people have been calling and emailing me since I started running complaining about different things that my opponent Chris Lee has been doing and so a lot more from you guys the community. Let's see. Of course, I researched everything made everything made, sure, everything was true. I took a lot of time reading these bills and news, articles and getting it checked and rechecked. And the last one is. He said, it's misleading that he voted for saving the rail because it prevented a property tax increase. Miss Isabelle also on my website. Because no one in the legislature, wanting it a property tax increase. It was this bill or nothing, and even if there was going to be a property tax increase, because the county would have had to do it and the county doesn't want to increase property taxes either. So it was the bill or nothing that it was saving people from property tax information. She wanted to save the real. And I think you should be more transparent to about what it means. Temporary funding 2022 with supposed to end. We are now giving his estate 25 million dollars a month to the rail. It's a on average $25 a month to $25 a month. And the cost is keep going up and up and up. I don't think that's fair to the taxpayers. So thank you so much for taking the time to watch a video. If you have an email me Kristina with a K. M.

I spend significant time representing healthcare providers, so I see systemic problems with our health system up close. Everything from the PASSE system, to holes in the Arkansas Works Medicaid Expansion, to providers struggling to stay in business because they aren’t getting paid for their services.   Here’s the thing:  Expanding access to healthcare in Arkansas is one of the very best investments we could possibly make in our state’s economy. Healthcare is a massive part of every local economy:  Small businesses can’t survive where there is no access to healthcare, and towns that lose hospitals or clinics tend to dry up.   Here’s what I want to work on in the State Legislature:   1. Expand Arkansas Works coverage to include more vulnerable Arkansans, so that our rural clinics and hospitals don’t close. The Medicaid expansion has been a boon to Arkansas’s economy, and I’ll fight efforts to undo it because it’s saved Arkansas lives and Arkansas healthcare providers.   2. Work to make sure Arkansans with pre-existing conditions can be covered by their insurance provider at rates that aren’t predatory.   3. We have to get prescription drug prices down, and this is urgent especially for seniors and Arkansans on fixed incomes. If an Arkansan needs a medication that will save their life, they should get that medication and it shouldn’t drive them into bankruptcy.

My name is Jorge. I am an editor with we are me too and I'm here today to interview Julie Chavez Rodriguez the deputy campaign manager for the Biden campaign. I want to thank you so much for you know having me it's great to be able to join you all and to connect with so many of your viewers and folks today. Of course will thank you for joining us. We have a lot of questions about a lot of very important issues. So let's dive right into it. You know, there's a lot at stake right now for Latinos weather. It's you know immigration Health Care there so much going on right now in our community with all of its intersectionality is really at risk. So my first question to you is why do you believe in a Biden Administration? I had the opportunity to work and the obama-biden White House to see him firsthand really, you know throwing down in 2013 when we were pushing hard for the passage of immigration reform really immigration reform was something that was important for our public safety important.  Are our businesses and our economy important for you know, really the future of our country, you know again, I've seen him first and and I can say the same is true for Kamala Harris. What else does the Biden Administration have planned when it comes to immigration and fixing the system to help those that are coming here to seek a better life donde one Gap Joe Biden would one but a hundred a moratorium on deportations while we looked at fixing and re-implementing some  Critical priorities within our immigration System including reinstating DACA and ensuring that dreamers that were protected under the program continue to be protected. And also we opening the program so that those that have aged in since the program was established or able to apply and seek that same kind of protection. He would also send Congress to push forward a comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill that really looked at modernizing the system we need to restore.  Be into our immigration system. What does Biden plan to do to help Americans get Affordable Health Care to help people like me afford their prescription drugs and have affordable access to healthcare, especially when it's a pre-existing condition. I would say one of you buy them, you know proudest achievements with passing the Affordable Care Act with Barack Obama early in their administration because you know for him Health Care's personal there's so many families who have you know, come across after months of treatment.  And all of a sudden that surprise bill that ends up, you know costing them huge amounts of money. These are the things that again are keeping many Americans of the night, especially as we're dealing with this Global pandemic and I know what has Grave consequences for the Latino Community, you mentioned a little bit about the impact of covid on the Latino Community when it comes to health, but another another major part of what's happened is the economic loss where Latinos they are one of the hardest hit when it comes to job specifically about being as because  A lot of those jobs involve a lot of person interaction being indoors, whether it's you know, being made cooked through so much that goes on with those jobs. So what is the plan to get these Latinos back to work? I think at one point, you know, New York's off 44 percent of Latinos out of the job. I mean I couldn't agree with you more in terms of Latinos being one of the hardest-hit communities as a result of covid. I mean just, you know to shed light on over 42,000 Latinos have died as a result of  By then put forward a plan to you know, one get the covid crisis under control first and foremost. So that's ensuring, you know, testing treatment ultimately the vaccine is available to all workers regardless of immigration status because we know that this pandemic does not, you know, sort of differentiate based on country of origin our citizenship. I want to shift gears a little bit and talk about what the legal there is a new kind of pocket of Voters in Florida, which the Latino  Community there is traditionally very conservative because of the Cuban Americans. What would be your pitch to people for Puerto Rico now in Florida to go out and vote and to be more active in politics now that they're living on the mainland because you mentioned Florida is such a really important date but also very interesting and diverse State when it comes to the Latino population.

The GOP strategy to win is to use their billionaire donors to flood battleground states with fear mongering, racist ads and messaging to rally their base toward Trump. We could never match their spending dollar for dollar—but luckily, we don't have to. Because here's the truth: The most effective and impactful campaign strategy is not sending generic, inflammatory messages far and wide, it's actually highly targeted outreach to small groups of voters who are most likely to tip swing states blue.  We’ve built detailed models to identify ""high-potential,” progressive voters in order to turn out 100,000 people who would otherwise not vote across the 14 most important battleground states. If we're able to achieve this, it could clinch the election for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  But mobilizing these voters is expensive. We have to purchase thousands of ads, send millions of text messages, and create customized videos, then do it over and over again through the election.

x_1652950271545771,"Two months ago, we learned that President Trump apparently ignored reports of Russian targeting of U.S. Marines in Afghanistan. That story appears to have been forgotten and given the daily outrageous conduct by this Administration, it is disturbing yet not surprising. Maybe it’s being investigated and we’ll get some answers in due time.  Yet, here we are again. I mentioned before that I have a daughter in the U.S. Marines and I would like to say more about that. She is a Second Lieutenant and in two weeks she will finish her training and begin her career as an officer in the service of her country.  This is all a new world for me since and aside from grandfathers who served in World War II, I have no personal connection with the military. But, as any American, I was raised to respect and honor their service and sacrifice. Anybody who has studied history would have to appreciate this, from the American Revolution to the Civil War to today.   I don’t personally know any other moms here who have children in the military now although I am certain I represent many who live in my district. Looking for information on her “graduation” I found the Facebook group for The Basic School (TBS). TBS is the level of training after Officer Candidate School. It’s great to see the pictures of the training and individual stories of those in training. However, every Sunday the site posts a picture and story of a Marine killed in action over the years. A reality check of what it means to be a Marine.  Are they “losers”, “suckers”? According to our President, they are.   In politics, there is a lot of empty rhetoric, lots of talk and no action. “Support the troops” comes to mind. What does that even mean? Putting a flag sticker on your car? Making a Facebook post?   I’m a Democrat so I see that Republicans have appropriated the patriotic, pro-military position. Where are they now? Are they choosing to support the worst President we have ever had over our members of the Armed Forces? I, however, refuse to defer to them on who is more patriotic, or who supports the troops more. I’m going to say it: I support the troops and I am calling on all my colleagues and especially my Republican opponent, an Army veteran herself, to stand up to this horrible president and distance themselves from his abhorrent rhetoric.   My daughter is most definitely not a “sucker” or loser”. She is a classically trained harpist who graduated from the top program in the country. She trained and worked for three years in Philadelphia as a professional paramedic saving countless lives. She is an amazing sister to her six siblings and has proven to me she can do anything she sets her mind to.

The GOP strategy to win is to use their billionaire donors to flood battleground states with fear mongering, racist ads and messaging to rally their base toward Trump. We can’t match them dollar for dollar, but luckily, we don't have to.   Our secret weapon: We've identified 7 million high-potential, progressive voters across the 14 most important battleground states who might otherwise stay home on Election Day. If we can get just over 1% of those 7 million people to vote for the Biden-Harris ticket, Trump will almost certainly lose. One percent. That's it.  But voter turnout programs like these are expensive. We have to purchase thousands of ads, send millions of text messages, and create customized videos—then do it over and over again until the very last vote is counted.

We need to stop in their tracks the generation of Trump wannabes who are already being talked about as 2024 presidential candidates: Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley, and even Donald Trump, Jr.  My friends at MoveOn are some of the country’s most effective grassroots organizers, and this year, they’re using a super-effective strategy called ""Vote Tripling”. This strategy is rooted in social accountability—if people know that their friends, family, and neighbors are paying attention, they're much, much more likely to vote. So, MoveOn is mobilizing its millions of members to encourage their family, friends, and neighbors to vote—and to remind them that if you don't vote, people will know.  This strategy has proven to be FIVE times more effective at getting out the vote than traditional tactics. This is how we can drive up the margin and ensure a humiliating defeat for Trump.   But MoveOn needs to raise enough money to run its Vote Tripling program in all the key presidential AND Senate battleground states from now until Election Day. I've seen MoveOn tip elections time after time over the last 20 years. And I know that MoveOn's Vote Tripling plan will work, but only if it's fully funded.

x_1024025138049363,"In my district to date, 11,300 or 61% of Democratic voters have applied to vote by mail compared to 4,600 or 25% of Republicans. The surge of enthusiasm we are seeing in Democratic voters in Pennsylvania is scaring the bejesus out of Republicans in Harrisburg. Their fear of a blue wave has caused them to embrace every trick they can find in the voter suppression handbook, including plotting to ignore the will of voters and using an archaic loophole in the United States Constitution that potentially could allow them to seat their own set of pro-Trump Electoral College electors in defiance of election results.  Voter suppression tactics are nothing new for the right wing but in this election their conniving has taken on an air of desperation as Harrisburg Republicans answer the clarion call of Donald Trump to undermine mail-in-voting and voters' confidence in the outcome of the election. Their goal is to create chaos, setting the stage for legal challenges to election results that growing evidence suggests will not be in their favor. Their full-frontal embrace of voter suppression tactics includes:  Attempting to shorten the time period in which voters may request a mail-in ballot Trying to eliminate satellite ballot drop-boxes  Appealing to the United States Supreme Court to reverse a ruling made by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court requiring election authorities to accept mail-in ballots received up to three days after November 3, as long as the ballots are postmarked on or before Election Day (a ruling made necessary because of Republican attempts to impede the Post Office’s ability to process mail-in ballots in a timely manner) Refusing to allow election authorities to begin counting ballots before Election Day Eliminating the requirement that poll watchers must be from the county where they seek to serve as a credentialed election observer And, to make matters worse, Donald Trump is hell-bent on stacking the Supreme Court in his favor in the event the high court has to serve as the final arbitrator in any election disputes.  Be assured that the Governor, legislative leaders and Democratic Party officials are anticipating and preparing for an array of legal challenges and electoral eventualities. Unfortunately, I do not believe we have a level playing field. We would all like to have confidence in our system of justice and electoral process but early indications raise legitimate concerns as to what extremes our opponents will go.  There is one sure-fired way to counter the chaos the Republicans are seeking to create. We must win this election decisively and we must flip the Pennsylvania House from red to blue. We need a victory that does not leave one scintilla of doubt as to the outcome. We must make this election challenge-proof and have a new majority in the legislature to prevent any further electoral shenanigans.  To that end, if you applied to vote by mail, follow the voting instructions (don’t forget the secrecy envelope) and mail your ballot as soon as you get it or take it to a designated drop box location. If you are not voting by mail, consider voting early in person at the Chester County Voter Services office from now through Election Day or at one of two satellite offices beginning October 5, 2020. If you plan to vote at your polling place in person on Election Day, please bring a friend or family member, vote early and stay safe.  Vote! Vote! Vote! The democracy you save may be yours.

Yeah, this is Adam galette with accuracy and media and we have one heck of a story for you today black lives matter. We've been talking about it all summer all fall. It's one of the biggest topics that people are discussing. Here's another one that people are often discussing this time of year two-faced politicians. Let me tell you about Iowa Senate candidate Teresa Greenfield she's running for It helping Chuck Schumer take back the senate in an incredibly conservative State. Now this puts her in a tricky position and she has to be publicly a moderate even if privately she has to be a bit more Progressive. And where does that leave her with black lives matter? Well black lives matter is incredibly unpopular in Iowa. Not only because of the violence that occurred there over the summer, but because one of their leaders has recently been charged with nine additional felony charges amongst other things. He allegedly was planning.  NG to shut down a highway put nails on the highway and staged a hostage situation to distract police from the violence. They planned elsewhere. This is not a non-violent well-intentioned reasonable individual who seeks to get reasonable reforms like ending chokeholds and demilitarizing the police. This is a radical violent organization. Now, what is Greenfield do she can't publicly support such an unpopular organization in Iowa if she wants to win, but privately she  To appease her Progressive base. So we went undercover and asked her husband what Teresa Greenfield really thinks about black lives matter, but she supports black lives matter, right? That's great. Great. She's okay.

In fact, he's a former communications director for a Democrat Congressman. So we knows politics and he knows Communications and according to him. He knows that Theresa Greenfield supports black lives matter and you might say maybe she just supports the Grassroots movement. Not the radical violent organization, not the Marxist group that seeks to  Don't the nuclear family. Well, we went to Theresa Greenfield directly and asked her what she really thinks about black lives matter and the black lives matter organization. We were reading through the website and she was wondering why the words black lives mattered don't appear on the website. Yeah. I don't know that there's any freezing it doesn't appear on the website. So let me take a look at it. Okay, because I talk about it all the time and you support the black lives matter organization. Yeah. It's like I just did a I just did a video it should be  up on my site and my sight now but we give a shout out to both the black legislative caucus for the more perfect union law and a black life matters and the activists.

And you know, we preached Integrity Integrity Integrity like what was wrong with this man slick Willie, you know, and we were very close to it because we were there in Arkansas as Arkansas was growing up to become, you know from an old South Democratic state to a Republican state and you know being a Christian also, you know, I felt integrity was important and so that became  Ingrained in me when I was a kid. And so when Trump came into office it was very clear the pseudo Christianity's practicing the lack of Integrity. I don't want to die knowing that I supported somebody that could wreak havoc on the future. And you know for my I've got two daughters I'm thinking about how they're impacted and you know and just the general discourse I think is been you know gut-wrenching so that's where I stand on it.

Trump's poll numbers nationally and in key swing states are tanking, and now it seems that his increasingly erratic behavior and lies may just be the final straw that takes the GOP-controlled Senate down with him.  We cannot let this critical chance to secure a Democratic Senate at the same time that we defeat Trump slip through our fingers, and with so little time left in the race, this is the moment to go big or go home.  Which is why MoveOn has a plan to invest $2 million in a massive ad blitz across three key Senate races to defeat Martha McSally in Arizona, Susan Collins in Maine, and Lindsey Graham in South Carolina. Winning these three races is the key to ending GOP control of the Senate—and terminating Mitch McConnell's despicable reign as Senate majority leader.  This campaign is funded entirely by small-dollar donations from people all across the country. Our ability to keep the ads up, run them during prime-time, and make sure the right voters see them is entirely up to people like you.

That’s why I worked with insulin advocates from across the state to pass Alec’s Law.  Big Pharma is fighting back and I need your help to ensure that Minnesotans can afford their prescription drugs. Are you in?  This has been a journey this bill and it began around the kitchen table of James and Nicole. My name is Nicole Smith Holt and I'm James Holt Junior and we are the parents of Alex Smith in 2017. Alec died from rationing. His insulin is rationing it because he could not afford it for type 1 diabetics insulin is like water and they're literally being priced out of their lives.  So we set out to pass a simple Bill one that says no one should ever lose their life because they cannot afford the insulin they need to survive. There are entrenched interests always willing to fight back but what those special interested in how those ordinary minnesotans driven by love for their families through the brothers or sisters. We don't cause an ox their fellow minnesotans.  I did nothing to get type 1 diabetes. No type 1 diabetic has  and yet we're paying for the actions of the greedy pharmaceutical companies and lawmakers and me along with the rest of the diabetes Community are facing the consequences for that.  I live in New Brighton Minnesota and I have had type 1 diabetes for 25 years. I joined the fight for the Alex Smith emergency insulin act because for so long insulin has been a financial burden and it has been hard to access an emergency situations. My daughter has Type 1 diabetes and she's only 9 years old. I joined the fight to pass the Alex Smith emergency insulin act because I wanted to make sure that she and all people with diabetes.  Never have to ration their insulin diabetics can't keep waiting and we need action now.  And we're going to keep fighting until we have affordable accessible insulin for all the fight for affordable insulin shows us the immense power what happens when we lead with our humanity and we fight together with a full heart. I ask you all to vote Yes on the Alex Smith insulin affordability act. Thank you.  We were able to pass the Alex Smith insulin affordability bill with passing that bill. I've never been happier in my life. We were able to create a safety net and a long-term program that will help save the lives of people of Minnesota who are also going to ration their insulin.  Alex law is now the law of the land, but we're not done fighting as we speak. Big Pharma is suing us to try to stop Alex lock from continuing meanwhile minnesotans across our state are still struggling with the high cost of prescription drugs. I am all in for the fight for prescription drug affordability for all minnesotans, and I hope you'll join us too.

We were told that this staffer was in fact reprimanded this really speaks to the tension right now over Healthcare in the pandemic and this case you have a cancer survivor who is reaching out for help.

But for Mitch McConnell and the Republicans controlling the Senate, the only thing that matters with so few days left until the election is ramming through Trump’s illegitimate Supreme Court pick—not protecting families from eviction, ensuring that everyone has access to free COVID testing, or providing desperately needed funding for cities and states hit hard by the pandemic.  The Republicans know Trump’s poll numbers have recently sunk even further—and could take down the GOP-controlled Senate with him. This opens up a golden opportunity to flip the Senate.  Which is why MoveOn has a plan to invest $2 million in a massive ad blitz across three key Senate states to defeat Martha McSally in Arizona, Susan Collins in Maine, and Lindsey Graham in South Carolina. Winning these three races is the key to ending GOP control of the Senate—and terminating McConnell's despicable reign as Senate majority leader.

But for Mitch McConnell and the Republicans controlling the Senate, the only thing that matters with so few days left until the election is ramming through Trump’s illegitimate Supreme Court pick—not protecting families from eviction, ensuring that everyone has access to free COVID testing, or providing desperately needed funding for cities and states hit hard by the pandemic.  The Republicans know Trump’s poll numbers have recently sunk even further—and could take down the GOP-controlled Senate with him. This opens up a golden opportunity to flip the Senate.  Which is why MoveOn has a plan to invest $2 million in a massive ad blitz across three key Senate states to defeat Martha McSally in Arizona, Susan Collins in Maine, and Lindsey Graham in South Carolina.

A shocking report in The New York Times recently revealed that the GOP plans to employ 50,000 people at the polls—some of whom will be armed—to intimidate Democratic voters across critical battleground states, focusing especially on suppressing Black voters and other people of color. The GOP also intends to spend at least $20 million on nefarious lawsuits designed to suppress the vote this fall. This is a stark and disturbing escalation in the GOP's voter-suppression tactics, a bald-faced effort to steal the election for Trump and the Republicans.  That’s why MoveOn is launching a massive, all-hands-on-deck campaign to protect our elections from Republican meddling and to defend access to the ballot box for every single American.

I figured I'll just jump in to give you my opinions on what happened in the first presidential debate. If you missed the debate, I'm going to give you a quick recap of what happened. Ah, ha ha ha would you laugh you like to respond to that was very informative first things first. We need new debate rules people Chris Wallace. Thank you for your service. And I hope that you have a lot of money for your therapy. You made it.  Valiant effort but you were not ready for this because no human being could have been ready for this. They don't need a moderator for this thing. They need a UFC ref Dana White get on it. Trump would not shut up right now. He's still in his bedroom complaining about how crooked Hillary rigged election that he wants. She totally stole it, but I got it. I brought it back. I grabbed it from her. I totally had it Pastor tooth placement on yeah, that's what I did. I grabbed it from Hillary. I mean at one point Chris Wallace was this close.  Two looking at Trump and saying nigga you got to shut the fuck up.  That was Chris Wallace losing his mind. So look moderators. You need to figure out how to handle Trump at a debate because this is not good for the nation. It doesn't work to just say mr. President, please. Mr. President, please please mr. President, please have you ever asked a toddler, please? Please put down the matches, please put that your house will be burned down around you. That's why milania scoffs the hand you gotta slap. The hand can be talking to a toddler. I'm telling you man. They need to switch things up need to figure something out do  Anything give the next moderator a spray bottle just to Spritz them anytime. They interrupt. I promise you Trump will be quiet because his head turns into a gremlin if it gets wet just spray him. You know, what even better give Trump $100 for every time he lets Biden finish a sentence. Yeah. I mean the money is a great incentive for him. And now that we've seen the tax returns, we know that he needs it and whoever decided on this format needs to be fired because I don't know about you at home, but I have never and I mean never wanted to see a commercial.  Shal break more badly in my life. I cannot do 90 straight minutes of this shit ever again. It was brutal. There's got to be a commercial break every five minutes and during those commercial breaks. Every AD should be for antidepressants or some drug that has side effects that make you forget the last four years and honestly if you went to a commercial in the middle of this thing, I bet even the guys in the ad would be flustered and we still thrown off by Donald Trump. They'd be like a I was gonna tell you about the the cat litter or hotdogs or  I can't remember anything I do. I'm sorry. I guys I don't want this ad is about that guy just kept on these debates need fact Checkers. Why am I the only person who steals it guys debates need fact Checkers because otherwise people can just stand on the stage and say whatever they want and there are no consequences zero NADA zilch every time a candidate says a lie, there should be some sort of like sign that they lied like maybe a brick should come down on this side of the screen, you know like Tetris  And then as they lie, it'll just gradually build up higher and higher until it covers their face. I mean the best part for Trump is that five minutes into the debate. He'll finally have his wall. There are so many places where there is no truth Twitter Facebook partisan news networks these debates at the very least should be a place where people can tune in and expect some kind of fact check, you know, you can't just have both candidates making things up if they're going to make things up as like you don't know is Biden telling the truth. I think so is Trump would you that's definitely a lie, but no one's saying anything you can.  Have them decide when its allies like the NBA finals and then all of a sudden they're like, oh, yeah, you can call your own fouls. No that's chaos. You need an actual ref on the court people. I mean the one upside of this whole night is now we know what the fight club sequel look like in 40 years. That's the one outside. In fact, that's what we should do, which is let these guys wrestle just let them physically wrestle each other because the reality is everyone's made up their mind. All right, there's no such thing as an undecided voter. It's just people too embarrassed to say how they'll vote. So  entertain America at least with two old men wrestling and the winner gets a free hip replacements. So I don't know guys fresh after the debate. What is my take away? I don't actually know I mean, I don't know how Biden did because Trump did more interrupting than Kanye West in a room full of Taylor Swift's it sounded less like a debate and more like the radio was stuck catching to station grab wouldn't and Hickory. Hey Lorenzo. This guy's a clown girl, please. Mr. Pritchard. I can't believe that by now.  Managed to keep any train of thought that was impressive you want to talk about being a copis mentis for being president pay attention while Trump is trying to interrupt you the whole time. It's like having a little devil on your shoulder, but they're not trying to convince you of anything. They're just trying to mess you up. Yeah, that's what union 50 there - that it's a lab. Where is my baby? I was watching that debate and I kept forgetting where I was. I actually hope Biden was taking drugs because that's the only way I was able to get through the debates and as for Trump's performance, two things one now we  Finally know what it would be like if he read his Twitter feed out loud and too. I can't believe how hard his brain malfunctioned when they asked him to denounce white supremacists. Will you denounce the proud boys? Mr. President? Well, yeah the prayer but we're stand back and stand by boys. So after the first debates, I don't know if anybody wants. All I know is for the next debate.

My opponent likes to say, “You know Jack.” But he’s out of touch with your values. And he’s afraid you’ll figure that out before Nov. 3.  ❌ He pretends to be a moderate while voting time and again with the most extreme wing of his own party and mocking voters who disagree with him.  ❌ He accepts campaign contributions from supporters who want to siphon public tax dollars to support private schools.  ❌ He believes that Statehouse lawmakers know more about women’s healthcare than their doctors, and he will continue to attack women if he is re-elected.  ❌ When thousands of women marched to make their voices heard, he mocked them on social media and called them fat.  ❌ As a city-county councillor, he had an opportunity to stand up for same-sex marriage, and he refused. And as a State Senator, he had the opportunity to fight for a real hate crimes bill; instead, he stood on the sidelines and we now have the most watered-down hate crimes bill in the entire country.

x_1015667292212360,"URGENT: Trump is ratcheting up his attacks against the Postal Service in an effort to both harm the USPS and devastate Americans’ access to voting in one fell swoop.  His lackey, postmaster general Louis DeJoy, has made changes to slow down the mail and displaced experienced USPS staff ahead of November's elections. The head of the House subcommittee overseeing the Postal Service called the changes “deliberate sabotage.”  Slowing down the mail means a delay in delivering lifesaving medications and unemployment checks—and delaying millions of mail-in votes so they go uncounted or invalidated in November. The people hit the hardest are those in rural areas and older Americans who tend to rely more heavily on the Postal Service.  That’s why MoveOn is creating a powerful TV ad campaign about Trump’s attacks on the USPS aimed at seniors in the swing states most important to Trump—the same voters who are at the highest risk of the coronavirus and most reliant on the Postal Service. These seniors are a key constituency that Trump needs to win in November for his re-election.  We need to keep this ad on the air for as long as we can, but to do that, we need a consistent stream of funding.

We're going back to work. We're going to be out front as your leader. I had to do that.  I knew this danger to it, but I had to do it. I stood out front I led nobody that's a leader would not do what I did and I know there's a risk there's a danger but that's okay and now I'm better and maybe I'm immune. I don't know maybe I'm in the you maybe I'm Spider-Man and I can shoot webs out of my wrist who knows pew pew pew pew what the hell kind of a thing is that to say, maybe I'm immune.  And I don't know it sounds like the last thing a frat bro says right before he drinks the toilet water for 20 bucks. But I mean at least now we know how Trump is going to try spin this whole episode, you know, it's not that he was so reckless and ignorance that he got himself and possibly many other people dangerously sick. It's that as a leader he was brave enough to confront the virus head-on just like the only way to study marine biology is to get eaten by a walrus. And now that I think about it, it's actually an amazing excuse.  From now on I'm definitely pretending dumb shit that I do is actually Brave leadership guys. I had to accidentally eat too many Edibles and freak out in the park because if I didn't confront those talking squirrels who would and of course Trump being Trump every second of his return to the White House was choreographed for maximum television impact this morning. President Trump is back at the White House the president stood on a balcony and removed his mask in a dramatic.  Gesture May double thumbs up a salute and no mask. The president is going inside those doors and then he comes back out still without a mask on apparently to reshoot his entrance into the White House and it's about four people within close proximity of the president who of course, like we said is not wearing a mask. This is part of this stage entrance at the president is making where he wants to be back at the White House God. Damn.  The dude ripped his mask off the second he got home and I know Trump thinks this is a triumphant moment, but he's presumably still riddled with covid and he's about to walk in the doors and expose it to everyone inside. You'll just run the photo up was a biological attack on the White House. I mean there was a photographer standing right next to him. That dude is basically the world's unluckiest Instagram boyfriend. I honestly can't believe this this is Trump putting his own staff at risk.  You would think he would be a lot more careful about protecting his own staff. This is Coronavirus. Not a prison sentence. You can't just popping them off to it's no more Corona. You're good. What doesn't work like that? Okay, my bad now, it would be hard to believe that Trump getting infected going to the hospital and then going home once he was slightly less sick is some kind of impressive victory for him. But team Trump wants to go even further.  And they're trying to convince you that Trump getting covid is why you should vote for him. The president has coronavirus right now. He is battling it head-on as toughly is only President Trump. Can the president bite by fighting. This is kind of leading the way he's a general that leads from the front. He's not asking people to take risks that he doesn't take that's what America needs right now. We need somebody who's gonna get us to realize that we can live with this risk. This is  like when the general gets wounded by the invisible enemy goes and gets patched up and then gets right back to the Frontline u.s. Senator Marsha Blackburn took to Twitter to celebrate. She says quote President Trump has once again defeated China, welcome home. Listen, he has experience as commander-in-chief. He has experience as a businessman. He has experienced now's of fighting the coronavirus as an individual those firsthand experiences. Joe Biden. He doesn't have those really  Joe Biden doesn't have the experience of being infected with Corona man. You almost got to appreciate the balls of the Trump campaign who else would come out and say look do we rarely want to vote for someone who understands how masks work? I mean by that logic Trump can't understand any issue until he gets his ass kicked by at first. He should be going around. Like how can Joe Biden saved the Auto industry when he has a smashed his hand closed in the trunk?  I'm ready look man. There's nothing Noble about getting Corona because you refused to be safe. But if they're claiming that Trump has gained valuable experience from personally being infected with the coronavirus. Well, what exactly is it that Trump has learned today the president sending this message tweeting flu season is coming up many people every year sometimes over 100,000 and despite the vaccine died from the flu. Are we going to close down our country?  No, we have learned to live with it. Just like we are learning to live with covid in most populations far less lethal, the president of the United States comparing it to the flu yet again going back to messaging. He used in March. He went back to this. It's just like the flu. We're back to this. I always back to this. Look. I don't know how it's possible to see all the damage that coronavirus has done this year then getsy  Risky sick from it yourself and then come out of the hospital and say it's no big deal. It's just like the flu, you know, you would think that somewhere along that Journey Trump would pick up a tiny tiny bit of knowledge. But hey, maybe he's immune to that too. I don't know.

I consistent understanding of the Constitution has been the Senate must do so as well period they have an obligation to do so all the Republicans have a breathtaking refusal to meet their constitutional duty to give Justice scalia's replacement a timely vote and a fair hearing. I'm amused when I hear people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution.  Suddenly reading into it a whole series of Provisions that are not there. But this is absolutely within precedent. There have been 14 different cases where the Senate has confirmed someone in the last year of a president's term and this is not a three-year term. It's a four-year term evidently. It isn't enough Republicans to merely shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States of America.  They must have attached the Supreme Court to Republicans have obstructed the Congress obstructed our president and now they want to obstruct the court as long as they continue to hold that Supreme Court seat vacant so that Donald Trump can fill it Senate Republicans are tied at the hip to Donald Trump and are not doing their job historically. This has not been viewed.  As a question, there's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off. Here's that's not in the constitutional text.

See their answers here:  Americans work hard and pay into Social Security with every paycheck. We must keep Social Security strong. So current and future recipients get the benefits they've earned. What is your position on strengthening social security for current and future Generations?  You are 100% right that for current retirees and near-retirees Social Security should continue with no changes. It's a vital Lifeline for those folks and it's a it's a planning feature for millions of Americans as they approach retirement age, but the problem is and anybody with an ounce of political courage will tell you this. The problem is that it's unsustainable in the out years 30 50 40 years from now. It's unsustainable and it's going to fall apart under its own weight unless we take action.  And now you know, it said that the best time to plant a tree is 30 years ago. And the second best time to plant a tree is right. Now the best time to fix Social Security would have been 30 years ago or even 12 years ago when Mark Warner started his term in the Senate that would have been fine. We could have prevented very serious changes and now we're faced with we're 12 years closer to whatever fiscal catastrophe is on the on the horizon. So we need to be looking at retirement age for people who are younger workers right now we need to be looking.  Being at the funding formula for people who are younger workers right now. We need to be examining the premises of the disability program and and perhaps tightening eligibility rules around certain kinds of disabilities, which used to be work inhibiting and now they no longer are and we need to allow workers with disabilities to go back to work in a more meaningful way. All of those things will help us prevent the fiscal crisis, but you know, what's not going to is electing the same old people with the same old Hollow ideas.  And in that way, I guess I'm out of time. Yeah, sorry.  Well Joyce, you know with AARP we've had lots of discussion about this issue over the years and I took a lot of hits from my people in my own party for acknowledging the basic map around Social Security, you know again Atlanta, it was a kid 16 people paying in for every one retiree. Now, it's only three people paying in because we're living longer by 2030. It'll be two people paying in it's just math.  So I'll and lay it out very specifically and got a lot of grief. Yes for folks under 35 years of age we could phase in an older age over the next 20 plus years and a month every two years. I don't think that would be true traumatic second for folks like me who've done pretty well. We ought to go ahead and raise the amount of income that you can be taxed upon so-called raising the cap above the roughly 125 thousand dollar level it is  I think those of us who've been blessed to do well in this country can kick in a little bit more. We should do nothing to affect those who are already on Social Security and who are close to being on them, you know, obviously 45 and above but I think there's even more we can to we ought to look at the bottom 20% of folks and we had to raise the social security benefit because the bottom 20% they're not making enough because people are living longer we had to increase the benefit as well for folks over 80 and finally,  To stop those that's I'm working with Mitt Romney on this every 10 years. We need to readjust so security. So it solvent for the next 75 years common-sense bipartisan approach to make sure we keep our promise. Thank you 60  Yeah, you know another another feature of politicians is when they get to Washington DC and they get a black eye or they could beat up a little bit. They quit one thing you'll know about me from a brief look at my personal history, which you can read on Gabe for virginia.com. Once you look at my personal history, you'll know this. I will never quit when things are hard. I will never stop fighting for priorities that work for Virginia and work for America. I'll just never stopped. I'm a fighter and I  I'll always be a fighter. Now what you saw here what he just described. He's right. He did take some flak. He did get beat up by his party. Whatever that means in political terms. Maybe they had some mean tweets or something the truth. Is he immediately after a few black eyes a few bumps and bruises. He quit trying and that's why we haven't seen any sustainability bills.

Sundays are special, even peaceful, days when some join friends and family for worship services, sit down with children and grandparents for a meal or just relax and take in a football game. Unfortunately, not every family gets to enjoy these kinds of wholesome experiences.  Of all the actions Donald Trump has taken as President, many of us have found nothing more horrific than his policy of separating migrant children from their parents at our border. This policy has once again come into sharper focus with recent reports that our government cannot locate the parents of more than 500 separated migrant children and reunite them with their families.  This should come as no surprise to anyone. NBC News disclosed a Justice Department memo written in 2017 after federal prosecutors conducted a family separation “pilot” program and determined that children 12 and younger should not be separated because most would not be capable of finding their way back to their parents on their own.  In July of 2019, I introduced a resolution calling for the Pennsylvania House to condemn the Trump administration's cruel treatment of migrant families...  The Republican majority did not even allow debate on my resolution. By remaining silent and not stepping up to question the President’s family separation policies, the House majority's leaders and members were complicit in in the separation of children from their parents. I absolutely do not believe Republican voters in my district support the separation of children from their families further demonstrating how the right-wing majority that controls Harrisburg is out of step with local Republicans and nearly everyone else in our communities.  There are critics who say I should “stay in my lane”, the treatment of migrant children is a federal issue. I say to them, as a mother and as an elected official who represents thousands of people who truly care about this issue, this is my lane.  The insensitivity and lack of leadership on this issue displayed by the Republican majority in Harrisburg is further evidence as to why we need to flip the Pennsylvania House form red to blue. Some would say this is simply partisan rhetoric but I say it is more.  Character is not only on the ballot in the Presidential election. Character is also on the ballot in state legislative races here in Pennsylvania. Do you want a legislature that blindly and enthusiastically embraces the cruelest policies of Donald Trump without question, or do you want a new majority that legislates with humanity and empathy? DAILY LOCAL NEWS Democrat condemns Trump administration's treatment of migrant children MediaNews Group Jul 11, 2019 MALVERN-State Rep. Kristine Howard introduced a Pennsylvania House resolution that would officially condemn the Trump administration for cruel treatment of migrant children at the U.S.-Mexico border.

A Senior Property Tax Exemption? It's a good idea. Our seniors built this country. They made America what it is. We want them to come to the Kenai Peninsula to enjoy their golden years. When the idea came forward to scale back the exemption from $350,000 to $200,000, I voted to put it on the ballot for the people to decide and they said no. That's the system at work. I would never shut the door on decisions like that without your input.  Compare that to Rep. Sarah Vance, who supported budget cuts that took senior benefits from our most vulnerable seniors without any warning. Those benefits are restored for now, but how safe are they when she has no real plan to balance the budget?  Here's just a sample of what I have done for seniors: ✅ In 2016, my constituent Peter Zuyus asked me to help create a Senior Citizen Advisory Task Force for the Borough, to advise local government on Senior Issues. I worked with Republican Assemblymember Wayne Ogle to get that passed. The only reason we don't have that representation today is that it was vetoed by then-Mayor Mike Navarre. ✅ Mayor Pierce and I cosponsored an increase in CARES Act funding to our Senior Citizen Centers from $10,000 to $50,000 to assist our seniors with COVID related expenses for reopening. ✅ This June, Anchor Point Resident and Alaska Commission on Aging Board Member Nona Safra invited all elected officials on the Kenai Peninsula—including my opponent—to learn about the needs of our community Senior Centers. I was the only elected official to take the opportunity to tour our senior centers with Nona.  My record speaks for itself.

The wealth Gap is even greater for people of color. That's why I asked me fights for racial Justice and economic Justice. They go hand in hand. Now, let's take a look at where the candidates for president stand on this critical issue. Here's the 411 Donald Trump handed out one point nine trillion.

Presidential campaign can be emotionally draining for the presidential candidate campaigning is physically and emotionally demanding the stress levels are high during campaigns and even higher if the person is actually elected to office.

Russia this we know  Whether or not he was compromised and whether that was a threat or is a threat to National Security supposedly. The mother investigation was supposed to find out some of these things they did not they did not report any ties. They did not look.  now in a new book  Michael Schmidt reveals that the justice department secretly took steps to what's the word on what it curtail curtail the investigation into Trump's personal long-standing.  And personal and business ties to Russia.  They did their best to throw things out of whack to protect the president and why do you do that? You do things like that when there is something to hide when there's when there's something to protect that's when you do it.  And that is the situation that the president found himself in right as that's the situation that the president found his cellphone. So the justice department. They're just running interference for Trump. And this is something that we've known.  But in his new book, this is the book of Michael Schmidt from The New York Times.

He's connected in the inner circles.  of Washington  So the new book that he has is based on, you know, a thousand over a thousand documents from across the federal government that had never been made public before.  So we're finding out new things things that we did not know before and when we're finding this out 60 days before the election. So you want to make sure that your selection is well informed you need to check out this book and it is it is something that the Trump presidency is something that people are going to look back at and  Are going to analyze it when they talk about.  Back in 2017 when the Trump investigation began when they talk about his presidency. I think that the first thing that they're going to look at is Trump firing Comey that is that it that is what really started a lot of of the hassles that he had to deal with right. So as I said, there's so many things in it.  that are  Surprising surprising before it and I want to talk about the health of the president but before we get there.  The things that baffled me the most about this book.  What was revealed you had all these investigations that were done by all of these agencies? There's suppose a mother is supposed to find this out Congress that all these investigations, right? Nobody investigated the most serious and basic thing which is Trump's ties his personal ties to Russia.  This agency didn't do it. Like they thought this agency did doing this is easy and you have all of these people working against the American people because the American people need deserve want the truth and the truth is the enemy of trump.  And people that support Trump and altered truth.  Rewriting the truth the truth has you see it, right the truth is the truth.  and that is something that  Trump's Behavior does not allow to come forward and anybody that's working for the Trump. They're worth their weight in Skittles. They're going to try to protect him and he only way you can protect someone like him is by hiding the truth. So we have all these investigations people are expecting mother to come up with some stuff, right? He had this investigation and they were never investigating what people thought they were investigating they were never going to  Come up with the real deal between Trump and Russia whether his personal ties. Why does he bend over backwards for they never investigated that that's not what they were there to do and that is so disheartening. We waited, you know, he was impeached for this all just kind of stuff. They never look at the real thing. This is why people get disenchanted with politics. This is why people get upset and frustrated they say stuff like my vote doesn't count because  it's a lot of games being played.  For three years. They've been telling us they were looking at stuff that they weren't even looking at.  Right and then people say he gets away with this he gets away with that and he's had helped. He's had help their people that are in the government and its agencies that are complicit in this.  He is not doing it on his own he can't get away with it on his own. He needs help, right he needs help. So, you know for years I've been trying to understand what is happening in the Trump Administration. Like what is going on? Like what what's really good? What are they doing over there? All right, and the Senate intelligence committee?  They released a report. This is a republican-led committee and they put out a report and the report raised more questions than actually gave answers, right but in regards to Clarity for Trump's relationship with Russia, I don't think we're ever going to get that. I don't  I don't think that we're ever going to get that and I definitely encourage people to check out that that book by Michael Schmidt. What I do want to talk about is the health of the president. This is something else that is discussed in the book. This is something that he was Trump was angry about and and and having a meltdown about and why why would he lie?  To be having a meltdown. Why is he upset and and let me tell you why?  The reason that he is upset is that he tries to he tries to portray this image of being tough being strong, right? But he's not tough. He's not strong the if you remember last year, he was rushed to the hospital. Let me say this Trump for all that. He talks about buying being sleep.  The different things like that that he throws at him Trump is the oldest elected president. This is not talked about enough and Democrats lay down what you know Democrats are I was talking to my father earlier today and Democrats are always playing defense right when other Democrats going to start playing offense when you're dealing with a personality like Trump, they have to play offense. You can't you can't always  Be catching up and responding to things that he's saying you have to make some of the the first step. You got to take the first step dealing with somebody like this.  So let's go back present. The president was taken to  the hospital was not scheduled visit and if you follow the President yesterday, he starts going off and spinning out of control claiming that he did not have a stroke right? No one reported that he had a stroke.  No one reported that no reporters. I mean people may have said that online but there were no reports about him having a stroke. It was there was none right but he started talking about that. And yesterday he said his one of his one of his tweets. He said that it never ends now they are trying to say that your favorite President me.  Went to Walter Reed Medical Center having suffered a series of mini-strokes never happened to this candidate fake news. Perhaps they're referring to another candidate from another party.  And what's so strange about that is that you know, how you have someone in there there say the walking in the store. So you work in the store their shopping and they have their hands behind their back.  And you know as someone who works in the store you walking you're just walking around the store just kind of looking at the patrons and if the person with their hands behind their back just comes to you and says it no no candy in my pocket. I didn't I didn't take any candy. I didn't steal anything and you're looking like no one said you stole anything like where is this coming from? Right? That's what the president that's what the president is doing. Right? No one said that he had a stroke we  Only talked about the actual things which is that he went to Walter Reed won an unscheduled visit and and he was not in public for three or four days after that. That's all.  These are facts, right? But Trump was was actually reacting from a former, press secretary for Bill Clinton and a an analyst on CNN. Right and Trump's trying to get the guy fired for things that  That he thinks are being said, but the president then gets his doctor to come out and say some things you want him to deny that the president had a stroke.  How the president didn't have a stroke going to call it something else. He clearly went to the hospital for an unscheduled visit late last year and the vice president according to through the book and according to reports was told to be on standby in case he needed to take over now. Of course when Pence has asked about this. He says listen to this response. He says that he does not recall ever being told that interesting.  It's yeah, did someone tell you that you need to be prepared to take over if the president's incapacitated? I don't recall being told that you know, you would just say no, right he doesn't want to say no because that would be a lie. The you just want to be held to that. So he says I don't  You don't recall is but this is the kind of stuff that unfortunately Americans have to deal with when it comes to this President whole bunch of smoke screens and all of the talk about and Trump's tweets about him not having a stroke in about it. Definitely didn't have a mini stroke all of this talk about Strokes.  Has sparked more speculation as to his health the president's Health at all.  so  You know is he well enough at a told you the beginning of the of the program that the presidency takes a major major effect on people. It's not it's not a joke. It's something that is a stressful job and Americans need to know whether or not Trump. The oldest president ever elected is healthy enough.  To remain president and and to be president. Is he healthy enough?  I think that that is an important question. They've done all this talk about Joe Biden who seems to be fine. He's putting out videos them running and lifting weights doing some things that Trump would never do Trump does all this golfing. He can't he played golf good. I mean, he's not good all the plane that he does. He can't really play right? He doesn't do anything. He eats a lot of crap and  Being Donald Trump has got to be the loneliest job.  Right all these people around you going to jail. Can't trust them sister doesn't like you.  brother allegedly died of Coronavirus  all these people want stuff from him. No one's really his friend. Right? I mean being Trump has got to be lonely. It's got to be lonely.  Definitely lonely job but is the president healthy? It's a president more healthy than Joe Biden. Is he? I don't know. I do know the Donald Trump's the oldest president elect it that's interesting something that we need to look at. Why was he at Walter Reed? We're going to find out.  Going to find out how many thoughts in the comment section Instagram Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Tick-Tock at the Diamond K show at radio on fire. A lot of trump supporters get mad at me. I understand, you know because Trump's your guy, right so to get mad at me and he say stuff and I know it's fine and I enjoy talking to them. I enjoy hearing their perspectives. I don't agree with it. We are entitled to our own opinions. But like I said, I love talking to people who don't agree with me, but at the end of the day  I think we do agree on the fact that we love the country and we want the best for the country. If Trump was the best for this country. I would say it but that's just not the case. He's not what's best for the country. And you know, I think that it is obvious when you look at the way he's handled so many so many things.  The way that he's like a pirate pillaging the government Trump. I'm talking about. He's a pirate.  and his kids  his minions his sheeple all his stuff.  So disgrace today, I'm disgrace moving on the Preakness Baltimore. The Preakness will be held without fans.  I mean you got a lot of sports in a plane without fans right most. All right, but fans at home what the NBA is doing. I like the NBA is doing I like but the Preakness delayed until October the third as a result of coronavirus judge the Trump virus the Trump virus, but it is going to proceed without fans in attendance.  The organizers announced today Stroh Nach group and the Maryland Jockey Club have been working very closely trying to figure out how they're going to do this horse race without people very interesting the infield fast canceled. Naturally. I mean come on the race is going to air live on WBAL  TV and on WBAL news radio 1090 FM 105 101.5  so that's interesting. The ticket holders will be able to transfer see that see that works the I did that transfer. They ain't give you your money back, but you can transfer your tickets to next year's race, but I'm a joking but you can you can apply for a refund the full refund or transfer, but I think a lot of those people that buy that stuff they're going to probably transfer but  Can get more information by visiting the Preakness.com Preakness website is freaking this.com. So as we continue to move forward the coronavirus contrary to popular belief coronavirus is not over it's not done. It's not finished. Somebody needs to tell the governor the governor of Maryland so many to tell the president to that it is  is not over right on fire is a digital media company providing news opinion entertainment and since 2007. We have been reporting and we have our primary production operations in Baltimore and Atlanta.  And you can advertise and find out more about our shows here. We have many shows and how you can advertise or partner with us.  Radio on fiverr.com / advertisers where you go to find out more about advertising. So also what there's so much I don't even know. I don't even know where to start. We were talking about the coronavirus and The Rock Dwayne Johnson.  And his entire family have coronavirus took to ig to reveal that tested positive. So his wife he has two young girls all recovering from the virus and he said this stay disciplined boost your immune system commit to Wellness wear your mask.  protect your family  be strict about having people over your house or Gatherings stay positive and care for your fellow human beings stay healthy my friends and so, you know, I think that sometimes people people act like is is all good in Maryland movie theaters and moved into phase 3, as of Friday conveniently right before the holiday and I think that it  Probably too soon to move to phase 3, but some people say we gotta get back to work. We got to you got to get things back moving again. And if you do things too quickly just because you want to do it.  If circumstances have not changed you're going to still get bad results.  But people are feeling like it is time to move things forward.  That's what so that's what's happening in many cities across, you know across the country. So I yeah, I don't know how I feel about that. I don't I don't want things to remain stagnant. But at the same time if we do not have a vaccine if we have an Airborne virus still floating around.  I mean is it time? No, it's not it's not time.  One point in this election that frustrates me.  Is the focus on quote-unquote Law and Order. So Donald Trump is having a big focus on Law and Order what he is calling his  just a refusal to he's focused on the protest right and people protesting but there's no discussion. There's no discussion at all as to what people are protesting for. He's only reacting to the protests themselves.  And what is happening is there is police violence against unarmed black people.  There are things that need to be changed and as we continue to see incidents happen over and over and over again it is it is just beyond maddening. So there is a video.  that shows LA Sheriff's shoot other of the black man in the back and this surveillance footage shows the moments just before the fatal shooting of the 29 year-old Dijon kazee, and you know the  The police claim that he was armed and after he was initially stopped for violating vehicle codes while riding his bicycle.  Video shows him getting into a physical altercation with the officer prior to the sheriff unloading on him. I just don't understand it. And I know a lot of we've had several, you know police right, you know high-ranking police people talking about this and the danger that officers are in etc, etc. And I understand that but at the same time there's  there is a it has to be a  Equal or a reasonable?  Implementation or use of force exhibited right and unloading a full clip. I'm going to clip this is that's not reasonable to me. That's not reasonable unloading the clip. So hundreds of protesters gathered outside of the South Los Angeles sheriff's station.  yesterday  and demanded answers for this shot and killed 29 years old Dijon kazee pronounce that right because he and so I just this is very troubling case admit many troubling cases and I constantly have quote-unquote Law and Order people right? No talk about how these people are criminals and this or that they're going to their background. Oh the hole  Thing that mainstream media does tearing down victims. It does not matter if the person had a record, it does not matter if the person was not perfect officer is not judge and jury and does not have the right to execute somebody and then hide behind the shield of I was in fear for my life every time every time no  No, and I don't care if he there has there there there are rules of engagement, right? Yes. I mean what happened to just a police officer whipping some ass, right? What happened to that? What happened to shoot him in the leg disarmed him and then locking them up, right? Why is it every time every every time you're in fear? They take it to ten execution every time.  But so that that is what's disturbing.  Disturbing why would the police shoot unarmed person?  I don't know, but maybe they don't know what unarmed means if the person does not have a weapon in his hand. He is unarmed.  So this is continues to happen over and over and over again and I can get into so many cases where where we've had situations like this.  And Republicans are going to continue to use people reacting to the deaths of other citizens fellow citizens, and they're using that as their platform ignoring ignoring.  How bungled the response to coronavirus has been which is still going on numbers still climbing people still passing away from this and there's never been a national strategy announced implemented for months. As you remember this White House ignored the severity ignore the severity of it.  But you know.  That's where we are.  Of course just tuning in you man down and Kate in here. And before we get out of here, I do mentioned briefly about this covid-19 in Maryland. The governor. Larry Hogan says that all Maryland businesses can open on Friday.  Now, of course, you're getting some contradictory stuff from the mayor of Baltimore City. We'll get into that in a minute. But he says that the governor says that all businesses in Maryland can reopen later this week as a state enters the fourth phase the third phase. I'm sorry enters the third phase of the coronavirus recovery plan, right? So what is he basing?  What is he based on this stuff on?  And what does that mean two people may be confused. What does that mean movie theaters and Performing Arts centers will reopen at 50% capacity this Friday 5 p.m.  Up to 100 people will be allowed at indoor venues or 250 people at outdoor venues.  So is great be weaker. Are we gonna have some super spreader events? Does that mean just go crazy? There's more there's more all retail stores as well as churches and houses of worship will be allowed to increase capacity from 50% to 75%  So you're going to see a lot of places increase and try to get you to come there.  Now the trick here is that the local jurisdictions will still be able to decide whether or not to file these State plans, but then putting it out there is going to lead to confusion and it is going to lead to citizens in certain certain jurisdictions demanding making a fuss about opening back up in a lot of cases because people are you know, I mean we get Cabin Fever  Here after a few days in the snow stuck in the house, right? So it's been months and months and know what we have been stuck in the house. Literally you can't leave the house obviously, but it ain't like it used to be.  Now I just want people to understand and remember the crisis is not behind us.  We must remain Vigilant in fighting this.  If we do not remain Vigilant if we do not.  Exercise caution here things could turn right back around and have to go another route.  You want we want businesses to remain open? I do what I want people to be safe at the same time.  The governor's basing this on declining Health metrics, and I understand that the state positivity rate is three point three nine percent as of today.  And the rate has been under five percent.  For almost seventy days, and I'm just saying that and we have had some good showing, but I just I think it's a little too soon to roll out things the way that they are, but maybe I'm wrong prove me wrong prove me wrong, Maryland. I just I just think it's too soon.  But I understand the people are antsy and I understand that people. I mean we got election coming up. What kind of effect is the election a lot of people are going to vote in person. What kind of effect is that going to have four?  My suggestion is that people vote absentee, but a lot of people don't trust that and they want to vote that know. What does that mean absentee absentee means that you're requesting a ballot and you're going to send it in a certain period of time. All right. Now that's I think is the best way to do. That's what I'm hoping that my parents do right they are in a sensitive generation as far as  Stage right here in that, you know 60 range and you know, I want them to do that and I encourage them to do that and hope that they're going to do that. A lot of people are going to vote in person. A lot of people going to be standing in line for a long period of time and we don't want something like the election to push things back.  Right, but we're definitely going to be talking about this and we're going to have some candidates on the program talking about, you know, the platforms and and such in the days and weeks to come but as always you made a McKay.

Right now there are decisions being made that will impact whether Native people can go to the doctor, whether Native land and water rights are protected, and whether Native families and communities will get the vital services needed to survive.   The Trump administration is doing everything it can to keep Native people and communities from being fully counted: cutting off the U.S. census early, making it very hard for people to vote in Indian Country – and now, they are trying to steal a Supreme Court Justice seat. We can’t let that happen.  While we've been under attack before, we're stronger than ever before to fight back.  Tell your Senators to ensure that Native people have a voice in our democracy, including a full and fair census count, and taking specific steps to assure that our votes are all counted in the upcoming election.  The stakes are incredibly high, and they are trying to silence us in any way they can.  Every issue that Indian Country cares about – Tribal sovereignty, health care, Indian child welfare, land and water rights and more – is impacted by the Supreme Court.

I believe it is powerful.  #SavingWisconsinTogether  https://wichmannforgovernor.com/donations/initial/  In this video. I'm going to show you why we the people keep losing through my conversations with voters on both sides of the aisle in Wisconsin. I'm realizing that a lot of people don't really understand why things are not really getting done. It seems like the voters are stuck in the weeds and the media and political parties, keep focusing their attention on these my new little details and very few can get up to the 30,000 ft level. Where I spent my time for the last ten years and understand how all the dots are connecting and why we the people are still. So in this video presentation. I'm going to show you step-by-step and hopefully helps you understand why nothing really is getting done regardless of the party.So here we have an example of Destiny on the bill is called, this one's called a defense, authorization Bill. And this article is written in December of 2019. But the house voted today to pass path of fiscal year 2020 defense, authorization Bill. Okay. Sounds like it's pretty straightforward, right? It was about the National Defense in the military and civilian for National Defense and establish a u.s. Space force. That's kind of funny. I have my thoughts on that as well. But Bill pages that were needed to outline this defense bill from the new, that's not exactly what happens. So here's a screenshot of the actual bill. Now the value, this is most members of Congress, barely get any time.Members of Congress. Have the 3000 page bill that they have to try and skim through to see how much garbage is in a garbage into this bill that's supposed to be about defense. And so, members of Congress, have to cast a vote for yes or no to pass this bill and they have to weigh the good and the bad. Alright, members of Congress can't get a straight, both. I want issue at a time. They have to weigh the good and bad in the bill and then vote to me. That is insane. And that is why another reason why nothing gets done for the people mixed up Wyatt. Nothing gets done for We the People is we have a short clip from the swamp HBO, documentary of the swamp and we were talking about how to bribe him. Listen up.Fabrika Capitol Hill Club. I remember, they invited me to a lunch with the staff was there, and he told me that I was wasting my talent on the transportation committee and the oversight committee that the action was really on the Ways and Means Committee. And the next thing you said, was my colleagues and I are prepared to raise the money that will be required to get you on this committee. To get you on the way to me Steady at first, you know how to spell it. He recognizes talent and I was looking at my cheapest.Now, you understand another reason why nothing gets done, next up. We have fundraising that members of Congress have to do and it's not even for their own campaign. It's actually for the party were talking Republican party or Democrat Party and this is called the other side of the street. And here's a clip where they talk about it first Han. We're doing very important location that defines the edge of where Congress does official business and where Congress switches in the fundraising anybody for money on federal property when you want a new committee assignment, let's say you're tired of being stuck on the Ethics Committee and you want on the powerful Ways and Means Committee that speaker is going to tell you is you're going to get out the fundraising numbers and say you're not doing enough work across the street. So when you hear that code sentence, we all know. What is he? Come down here across the street, get a list of rich people and start begging for money. Not for yourself, not for your own re-election before the party. Okay, so there you have it straight out of a represented, his own mouth who is in the, you know, in a daily told you exactly how it was. So let's get into my campaign. Now, what's different about my campaign versus any other candidate before, but possibly in front of me right now, is I actually understand all of the points that are keeping. We the people down and is causing the Decay inside of our nation. And also, Wisconsin, and I have a plan. I have put out a plan. I have even more still, haven't publicly publish yet of how we can change it once and for all. So, if you want a candidate who's running for governor, that knows how to put pressure on the right people to start getting things. Done for the for you, the people, Wisconsin. Okay, we got lots of your party affiliation. I am the only choice for you. Now, let's talk about my campaign. I'm going to be funded through small donations. So I have people ask me, you know. Hey, you know, how you going to compete with the big boys and I tell them it's going to be on you. It's going to be on the people Wisconsin that are not part of special interest groups, that are not connected multinational corporations to actually want to see. Something get done for this date that we're living that I call home. It's going to be on you and your small donations to raise the funds. Very efficient with budget. I've always been great with budget and making the most of them all throughout my corporate career. I'm good at bootstrapping. I'm very good at, okay, so I don't need millions of dollars to be effective. And in order to win, Wisconsin, I don't. Well, I need a few hundred thousand. Absolutely. So I'm depending on you guys, when you guys asked me if you want to go to come up here. I'm going to need a campaign budget for this to happen as going to pin on small donations. Okay. Well, maybe it is it going to change my strategy when I want to do for Wisconsin? Absolutely not. I could care less. I mean did they want their money towards me? Find whatever. I'm going to still use it. For We the People Campaign. It's my experience always find that interesting to ask about my experience, obviously, has not gone through all my videos on my social media M, and my website. They just haven't, because if you go through those videos, my experience will speak for itself. There's no other candidate coming on with their own voice walking, you step-by-step and all these important issues other than me. Okay, so I was leaving Wisconsin during the crisis during the lockdown during the masked men as opposing The Mask mandates. I was trolling the Milwaukee council members trying to get this to stop. I told you exactly how the math Mandy was going to be enforced, that they're going to leverage business license. If there was not a private business, a decision to do this. That the business was not the police, it themselves. I heard I told you to be bad for business. We're seeing small businesses closed, all throughout the nation, all throughout Wisconsin. I told you the exact strategy that the Deep state is using in real time. I'm not look I'm not going twenty-twenty hindsight. Looking back in real time. I would making these calls. Go check it out for yourself when people say this. Go ask, okay. I'm not upset. I'm just very determined. I'm going to get this through everyone's head. This is what is happening. This is why we keep losing. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of the old political regime. I'm tired of how this has been working, is not necessary. Okay, it's not necessary. The other thing that has been have been set up on both side, looking at Democrat and the act like political theater systems. I've been watching, I've been observing. What they're doing, a certain people get headhunted and then funded by this party or packed, I have with this as well. These people be able to act in the best interest of the people. We the citizens of Wisconsin or this party or packed wife because their campaigns were funded out of the coffers of these packs and in by the party, right? So that's what you have to ask yourself as you're analyzing the political landscape and what shape and a proboscis. And the race of Governor. I hope you enjoy this video. I hope you see the vision. I'm doing the strategy. If anyone ask about, get them involved in the conversation, show them at every single comment that's worth responding to and private message. I personally not my staff. No one else. I personally respond to you and I give you a, well, thought-out answer as best as I can with the knowledge and that I have Intel that I have right now. I'm giving you shouldn't give me time, but that is me person responding to you. I challenge you to go out to any other political candidates current political person running, you know, whatever and their social media and see what their level of involvement is personally not their staff. Not all the responses. What are they doing to respond to you? Okay, have her have a great day.

Trump] you’ll ever hear! 🇺🇸   Hear more arguments like this! 👇 https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-charlie-kirk-show/id1460600818  Why is a billionaire from New York who came down from an escalator who was twice? Maybe three times three times married in twice-divorced the most pro-life president American history. Why is it that it took a billionaire from New York who was formerly a Planned Parenthood donating Democrat to put Gorsuch in cavan on 200 Circuit Court judges on the Supreme Court. Why is it that a guy that never served before in American politics is able to renegotiate NAFTA get us out of the WTO. Get tell the who to go pound sand. Tell the UN to go pound sand renegotiate. NATO all together get us out of the jail. POA make sure those billions of dollars who sent a rant or not going there anymore move the embassy to Jerusalem recognize the Golan Heights deregulate the American economy make us energy independent. Finally build the wall. Why is it that that guy did it it's because every single other person that preceded him besides President Reagan was part of the problem. They are part of the very same community of people that were ivy-league-educated said one thing and did another were part of the ruling class that protected the agency protected the bureau protected the doj and as long as you said the right things and kept the deficits going raise the taxes,  We had to the industrial base boosted Wall Street profits kept the kept the borders wide open. So we get a for Nationals domiciled on this our country that do not share our values eventually get benefits. Their kids can vote against our own values. Then things will be just fine. Why is it that this guy's different? It's because unlike any other president. He could have been in the ruling class. He said no thanks. He had enough money to be the ruling class has got more money than James call me Andrew McCabe Peter struck stroke smirk his lover Lisa Page and the person who probably published his book combined a x  Hundred he's the only president in modern history to have his own plane and actually go to probably a smaller plane when he becomes president knighted states. You don't the only President presidents. That was a best-selling author.  Number one TV show The Apprentice NBC literally was in every single rap song was glamorized President Barack Obama said the American dream is to be what is to be Donald Trump? That's what he said. The American dream was why is that this guy's office on the populist here? He supposed to be part of the ruling class. It's because he's a Defector from it. It's because he was in the dinners. He was in a cocktail parties. He heard the language he heard the contempt that the ruling class the Wall Street financiers the Washington DC lobbyist in the Silicon Valley Elites that he had to be around. He knew the content that they had for the plumber.  Trish in the carpenter the bricklayer and the person building the very same building that he was financing. So he took the woman rink mentality the philosophy that built that woman ran quicker and better than anyone could have imagined despite the New York City bureaucracy in the municipal the municipal burdensome rules. He said I'm going to bring this to Washington DC and I'm actually gonna do something apologist never done before I'm going to tell you the truth no matter how brutal and honest it is. I'm gonna do what I say. I'm going to do from the time. You went down the escalator. He was the only person running for office that talked about  China immigration the two issues that are most affecting our country. Now, how was this possible because he listened to the very people the ruling class hated. He would walk a job site and you'd ask him what's on your mind says man. I'm really worried that we're going to take one of by China. I'm really worried that we're getting too many people in this country. I'm worried. I can't pay for health care. He internalized that's what a populist is someone who listens to the people. So what makes President Trump different. This is a president who didn't need his job as the only President American history is going to be poor after becoming president.  It then before he's not going to sign a book deal big enough to possibly make up for the games. His son investigated by every single Authority imaginable from Bob Mueller to the house intelligence committee Adam Schiff to the Federal Bureau of Investigation after being set up for that very same meeting. His business has audited and currently under criminal investigation by the New York attorney general for no reason and no grounding for other his other son. Eric Trump his charity gets shut down for self-dealing despite no evidence at all. He just wanted to give treatment to cancer kids st. Jude Hospital.  His 11 year old son under constant and daily attacks for just existing as a teenager or early, you know, 12 or 12 or 13 year old in this Society. How dare he live?  He's the only person that would be more damage materially philosophically and morally every other president ends up better on the back end they end up being able to write their stoic journal and drama being better respected. This guy is a vessel for us a vessel for those of us that have nothing but resentment for the kingdom of Washington DC the type of people that think everything is just perfectly fine because with it we we just built a her maze arm as is now in Reston, Virginia don't you know Louis  God's in Fairfax County everybody things are great. Didn't you know that we literally have Dolce & Gabbana now in Georgetown things must be wonderful you go into Washington DC to cranes are as far as you can possibly see the construction cranes. They're trying to rebuild the part the Parthenon the U du Giza Pyramids quicker than anything I've ever seen. It's more construction happening in these see perpetually why it's the only place in America. This is why eight out of 10 of the wealthiest counties in America around Washington, DC.  The only place in America where they get richer at gunpoint, they've A multi-trillion Dollar Cash Flow happening into their Center into their power structure every single year not because we want it if Chicago and Minneapolis in Detroit, if people get rich there they have to convince you to buy their products. Maybe it's manufacturing. Maybe it's automobiles. Maybe it's Best Buy which is of course a Minneapolis company, but Washington DC is different they do it at gunpoint.  This is why Trump is different and that's why I wrote the book.  Market Market, ladies and gentlemen, you will not hear  a better argument for the president of the United States  Then that two and a half minutes right there cut it Mark it drop it in. Are you a leftist? Are you Communists? Are you Marxist? Are you super right wing doesn't matter. You can't disagree with that. That is the best argument.

This impeachment process has shown us just how willing Republican senators are to throw our democracy under the bus to protect their criminal president. But they’ve done a lot more damage than just refusing to remove him. They’ve voted time after time to consolidate power in the hands of a few and to make our society less democratic so they can keep their jobs (because, let’s be honest, they know their policies are unpopular, so they need to cheat to win). That’s why we’re launching the Payback Project, to ensure that these Republican senators are held accountable for their bad behavior.   We’ve spent the last three years building the kind of movement that can take these senators head on, and we’ve got a comprehensive plan to defeat them. It’s payback time!

I'm a successful small business owner and have a sound understanding of economic principles that benefit the working class. Learn about my campaign at wichmannforgovernor.com  Why you should vote for me. I know many people have their own reasons to why they would vote for a certain politician or someone running for office. But these are my reasons why I believe you should vote for me. When you look at me. You are really looking at a piece of yourself. I truly am. One of you. I've been through much of what you've experienced in your life. I've had the joys and Sorrows, I've lost them. People that were important to me. I've been unemployed for 8 to 10 months during the 2008 crisis. I work in corporate jobs. I own my own business. I started it from scratch so I can relate and have empathy for most people here in Wisconsin, but most importantly through this journey. I took the time to figure out what it really will take to make this day. A wonderful place to live for all. Yeah. We keep blaming a party instead of the corrupt and failed structure of the system that we all operate beneath. I'm not referring to the Constitution, but rather the rosian of it over.Time. I'm here to create and develop a new system that will benefit all who are willing to contribute their talents and produce. That's the key thing. I personally did not come from privileged. I was not born into an elitist family, or positions of Power are expected rather than working to serve the common. Good of the citizen right now. The people in Wisconsin are suffering. They have feelings of hopelessness and not sure of the future. You don't need a short few months their entire world got turned upside down.What we really need is not two parties blaming each other. All right, we don't need politicians pointing fingers and you know, saying we can't do the right thing because if my, you know, the election cycle and I might risk losing my position. We need to put all that behind us and we need to start doing what's right for the people right now. No matter what, I go back to the famous words of John F, Kennedy where he said, ask not what your country can do for you to ask what you can do for your country, you know, too many people. We've been trained and fortunately to look to this entity of government that has all the answers somehow, and it's meant to solve all the problems and it can you give us free this and free? That I'mma tell you right now people that is an illusion. That is a lie. Most importantly that is a trap. That'll leave you at the end destitute hungry and poor. What is time to do now is for everyone to take individual responsibility for their own lives for more importantly.I'll have to recognize that it is a broken and failed system that is keeping us in this state of decay and there are people in power that want the system to remain because in doing. So it will keep extracting your life force out of you last drop of money. Your last little bit of you know, bloody ends up to the very top. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is fact, if you to the research, this is fact and can be proven time and time again, the multinational corporations hand-in-hand with central banks in the Federal Reserve and the government working all together in conjunction have created this monstrosity, this huge monster that is just pressing you the people while you are out of work, but you got your musically. One little stimulus, check of $2,400. There is corporations getting to the billion.I'm feeling the dollar with a click of a mouse. The central bank can create really into new digital currency and give it to whoever they want by whatever they want. But you can't do that thing for you, the people to wake up and learn learn. What's really keeping you down there in the solution to all this. I beg of you. Please come along on this journey and educate yourself to understand why nothing really changed your taxes, maybe get caught a little bit here and there and some nice things in a politician will throw you a bone, but does your life really changed? Does it really get better? Be honest with yourself? I asked you take a hard. Look. Is your life actually getting better. Has it gotten better over the last 10, 25, 30 years or has it slowly degraded. I'm willing to bet for the majority of you is slowly to created.I truly believe this is our one opportunity here in Wisconsin to first of all, right, all the wrongs that Tony eavers had done and to unite everyone. Write the people that are willing to come together. There's so much division separation between even Republicans and Democrats and no one's really thinking clearly anymore. My father said something interesting. He said, Jonathan instead of a mask mandate you command a common sense. And I had to laugh at that because we are lacking Common Sense on both sides of the aisle and it's something that I truly been blessed with two. Always maintained is a sense of Common Sense throughout my life. I mean, I have all the answers, you know why? I talked to many smart and supporters. Many people who message me my campaign page and I realized I don't have all the answers, but what I do know, if together we can figure out a better solution for our state than what we have right now. If you agree with what I'm saying, if it resonates with you, they keep telling my story. Keep sharing it with other people. I know all of you are great as sharing my content. Share this podcast.But this is just a short reason why I believe you should vote for me. Because together we're going to create something wonderful that we all want to be a part of. So the action I want you to take is keep asking the why questions never stopped Deep dive into the structure of the system as it currently stands today. And ask yourself.

Many conservatives think that the uninsured are just lazy and trying to live off the rest of us. But here’s five examples of why they’re wrong: Uninsured patients seen today*:      1. 33-year-old mother of five, married, husband works full-time, she works full-time as a home health aide, is currently on a chronic medication that cost between $150 and $200 per month.     2. 33-year-old mother of three, homemaker, husband works full-time as a trucker, she is on 2 chronic medications which cost over $200 a month     3. 49-year-old woman, homemaker, has advanced rheumatoid arthritis but has been unable to see a rheumatologist, she needs to be on a biologic medication to prevent destruction of her joints which will cost over $1000 a month.     4. 47-year-old man, runs his own business, has an undiagnosed endocrinologic problem, and has had a heart attack. He needs an extensive workup which will likely cost thousands of dollars and he is taking over a dozen chronic medications.     5. 46-year-old man, former contractor, disabled because of the severe injury to his brachial plexus but has not qualified for disability, thus far he has undergone two surgeries and needs extensive occupational therapy, but cannot work because of his injury.         Many of these same conservatives also claim to be Christian. However, they seem to have forgotten or never read what Christ said in Matthew 25:  “...what you do unto the least of my children you do unto me...”  If any of the above patients were Christ himself, would you deny him care?  *This was not an unusual day, fully 1/3 of my office’s gross income comes directly from patients.

They’ve voted time after time to consolidate power in the hands of a few and to make our society less democratic so they can keep their jobs (because, let’s be honest, they know their policies are unpopular, so they need to cheat to win). That’s why we’re launching a massive 2020 grassroots effort to ensure that these Republican senators are held accountable for their bad behavior.

He’s even refused at times to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses.  Fortunately, the election’s outcome isn’t up to Trump. It’s up to us. It’s critical that everyone votes and as early as possible. It’s also equally important that we be determined and prepared to protect the outcome of the record-high voting we’ll see this year if there is an attempt to overturn the results.   That's why, in addition to our full-throttled get-out-the-vote effort to help deliver a Biden win by an undeniable margin, we’re also committed to safeguard our democracy in case Trump tries to steal the election.

x_639989416694137,"The liberal media keeps attacking me, just like they attack President Trump. But instead of getting emotional or focusing on FEAR, now is the time to focus on facts. To look at policies. To recognize what President Trump has done for our country and how he's kept us safe.  Governor makes bad decisions like that, spills over, I speak. Of course, of of South Dakota. The Republican Governor has refused to order any Statewide covid restrictions by Corelli River in Sturgis, South Dakota. Under search underseas, seize, whatever, we all do that. I do that's late at night. Now those claims that this covid explosion is how much is 621 new cases, and Sevendust and a city idea that hospitals are being overwhelmed. Well, covid, patients only occupy 12.4% of South Dakota's hospital beds, but that doesn't tell the whole story because those Talking Heads, you just heard one South Dakota to fail because they didn't lock down in South Dakota. And what is that for? Well, some people really love it's called a job and unemployment rate. That is the second lowest in the country and look at how this Compares with blue states with things are really blue, New York, Illinois, California, Hawaii. Of course, they had the most Draconian a lock downs and descriptions total disaster zones. Don't even now it South Dakota governor Kristi noem Governor, apologies from those individuals. No, no apologies. Laura, but my people are happy. They appreciated. The fact that we didn't shut down their business, as we allowed them to be flexible, take care of health and protect the public while still taking care of their customers and their employees as well. So we're doing really good in South Dakota or managing covid-19, but we're all sorry, I was driving. I think people are really recognizing the leadership has consequences. And what we're doing is Health Dakota is Republican leadership. Governor noem, when you tour the country and I know you've done some campaign event for President Trump's, there is still a lot of women out there who especially women, I think more so than man for whatever reason they're really freaked out in the word. It's a business has been a terrible tragedy for the country about covid. And many of them think the president hasn't handled it. Well, but given what we're seeing in Europe with 200,000 cases now there and the economic damage. What can you say to the women of this country? Who are there? They're concerned. They're concerned about health. But Laura, we're having real honest. Conversations are also concerned about their children about their education. They recognize their falling behind every day because in some of these democratic-run states are kids still aren't in the classroom. They're all. So worried about Law & Order about raising their children on Safe Streets, and that's not happening in these blue States either. So, the women are recognizing that they care about keeping their children healthy, but also, their children are the ones who are the most vulnerable during this pandemic. And meanwhile, they're the one suffering. The biggest deserve their living in a world that is filled with anxiety and fear. Which the media is perpetuating, I which is a grave disservice to our kids and then they're also even be able to let their kids walk down the street. So I've just been telling folks that it matters who's in charge and matters. Who's making decisions that get emotional during campaign. What time to be emotional? We have to look at policies. What the president's supporters lockdown? They're going to walk across glass to vote for him. But there's a couple percentage points maybe that you can move the electric either way. What does he need to do tomorrow? To convince people who feel it is slightly uncomfortable about voting for him because of tone or temperament about the president at all. I think he knows other message that this country needs to hear and it's a message of hope. It's what he's done. He is the only guy. I know that literally has followed through on everything he promised. He said what he was going to do in 2016 and he has done it. He's done more to defend. Our fundamental freedoms in the last four years than any president has for fifty years. And then he just lets Joe speak. We're going to be just fine, and we'll really see the president. And has delivered so well, for the American people did not vote for President Trump. Currently, he's voted early as he's a former governor of Massachusetts. Now, senator from Utah. What about those Republicans? Very small sliver who are apparently just not loading for him. Well, shame on them. Honestly. This is a situation where we have a president that fights to defend this country and Joe Biden's policies that he's embraced. They will destroy America. The only reason I'm going to these days is because the choice is so clear. And what President Trump does for us by fighting for us to keep our constitution, in place to defend what our Founders envisioned for a country, to give our kids, a hope and a vision for what really is possible with the American dream that we need him back in the White House. And what Joe Biden has spent for fought for, in the policy is embracing, his campaign are extreme and know, and we will sweep will suffer the consequences if he's allowed to be in the White House.

x_1559341927596264,"Hear my thoughts on the recall and politics in general. I also give a nice shoutout to @[516459655505626:274:Congressman Bryan Steil] for his work in helping secure Kenosha around the 8-minute mark.  #SavingWisconsinTogether  wichmannforgovernor.com  Everyone Jonathan Wakeman cure. I want to start off this podcast by seen this. This video of podcast is not meant to cause any Discord within the Republican party. It's merely just my take or comment on was already been initiated and put out there. The recall took me by surprise as well in my gut. I felt at some point. The citizens would kind of reached their limit with Tony eavers and want to get him out and I can totally understand that. I also felt the timing wasn't, you know, is off a little bit because of November elections here. What would Trump after that was all done and completed great, you'll go to it but it seems like that set of pressure has built up to me. So great that the people are just never done with it. So what is done is done, it sits out there and it is what it is. I'm a podcast as a response cuz I'm like I said my inboxes lighting up with people.Give me all the different questions. So I wanted to clarify a few things. My initial intent and focus is always still going to be on the 2022 campaign. As as as my was original goal. Obviously if the signature requirement is met, I have said that I am. Will you be willing to run in that for sure throw my hat into the funeral recall race there as well. But right now, I'm still focusing on 2022. I want to tell I want to come and go over. Why I feel this. This is happening really. We are stuck in a two-party system and both of these systems are big machines, and there's a lot of money involved in politics, in this has been my own personal frustration. So, while I am a candidate running for governor. At the same time, I am also a taxpayer. I am a business owner. I am a citizen, a law-abiding citizen, right? So I share all of your same concerns and it's something I thought about, you know, for the last 10 years, as I've watched the machine grind on thePeople. That's what it's doing. Its grinding on. We the people on our backs. Okay, and what do you like it or not? There is a club. There is a club on both sides with into the tee sheet party. Okay, and if you're not in that inner circle, you don't get those nice advantages of what I mean. By the what are the advantages that tens of millions of dollars to push your name and brand new campaign across the state. So everyone will know you and and the trying to buy your love and this is the best person, right? That's ridiculous. That if you have to advertise a product continuously, you know, on TV, it probably isn't really that great of a product. But the product that sells via word-of-mouth, like wildfire, people are sharing, how you got check this out. It's an amazing product. Look, what, you know, a great results with it. That's a real good product ramps. And so that's how I'm framing what I'm doing. And that's who I am. I'm trying to bring the best product. The best ideas and the best idea the actual ability.Execute on these ideas. Okay, I'll forward the benefit of we the people that's it. So, you know, at the end of the day, my whole soul focus and interest lies on you. And so, going back to the recall, you know, listen, America is under attack by, you know, as very serious ideology of socialism, and they won't take it further into communism. We also have some fascism. There's a lot of isms in hair that aren't good, right? Really, really far away from the founding fathers and how we set the stuff is in power. Write the question is, what is the right time frame to remove that person? Well, the systems in a way to years and we'll see what happens there. So many people in the state of Wisconsin that don't have two months to wait, they need strong leadership. Making the right decisions so that they can restore their lives. They can have their get their jobs.At the store. So I can come there. The place to live a security right security from from terrorists. Burning down their cities and places of work in businesses. They don't have two years to wait. So while it might be nice to wait for a certain party tooth, hand-select the next person to put in these positions. All right, kind of an odd. When can I tell ya? It's your turn now, right? Cuz you're in the club, the people don't have that kind of time. They're not thinking that way. And I, I relate to them. I understand that, you know, and so, so that's why I think the people kind of reached their limit from excessive lock down to the mask, mandates to Kenosha. Bernie said that he's not bringing peace to the city. Law enforcement is under extreme pressure. Their hands are tied. They're only be reactive and proactive and I did a video podcast. Sorry podcast on how to be more proactive to help our officers and head off these.You know, these people hate when I say the term protest is not protest taters and that's right, you know, is it from burning down the building? And that's, that's what we need to do. So the people under so much pressure. And again, The Establishment on both side. They don't care about you. They really just don't care because there's so much money flowing through the hands of these organizations and government itself government was never meant to be this large. That's it. Done. Never meant to be this large. We're supposed to have a small little efficient government to offer the basic call the basic necessities to society to fulfill the basic infrastructure needs that we need to ShopRite and of course the security security of our nation. And of course our cities and stuff like that apart from that everything else, the free market needs to handle and why that's important becauseWow, we live on upper Earth that has financed financed resource. It's okay. There's only so many tangible physical thing that we all can divvy up and share. The problem has become is when you enter into Central Banking and Finance in a Wall Street, they did create out of thin air. They digitized what they call it would be considered currency. So we, we know we have a national debt of trillions of dollars. Right? Are there trillions of the, you know, I don't know how was right on the planet and they like the limit and how many people we have to sustain and ensure all the different resources. You can put in a quadrillion digit number into computer. It doesn't mean anything translated into the real economy, real world. The Wall Street Stock Market goes Higher and Higher and Higher and certain politicians brag about how high wall Street's going. People on Main Street in working their jobs, or they lost her job. They don't care.Not participating in the stock market. They're not getting any benefit from it. Right? So we don't care about it. They're hurting and they don't, they don't have any access to that. So between our politicians and and our leadership versus The Working Man and the Main Street, huge disconnect and design on purpose accident. I don't know. You can theorize about that all day long. I have my own ideas on how that's happened. But I won't get into in this podcast going back to the recall, you know, what is done is done. It's the paperwork has been filed, its out there. It's happening. We'll see how it progresses again, my team and I were still focusing on 2022, but it's the signature should, you know, if we should get the amount, the signatures are great. I'm happy to get in there and run against Tony eavers Bryce, wanted to put this out there. So you guys can understood my thoughts. And I don't, like I said, I understand where everyone's coming from. Everyone is at the boiling point of frustrated, we had violence on the streets inKenosha, you know, actual gunshot people died here. So it's serious. And I think a lot of this was, especially on the Republican side. As I don't, there's a lot of failure to move. I mean, very few. People were even coming out with certain statements and doing anything as a people wanted. Like why aren't we check what's going on with the Democratic party? Why are we not checking Tony eavers? Why does seem like he has free reign to do whatever he wants, right? He's out of control. And so the people are like well heck, if I left officials aren't going to do it. Then I guess we're going to have to do it ourselves and that's what it came to.I do want to give a shout out to Brian style. Very impressed with what he did there. He's told the story about what happened with Kenosha and how he called the Inkster call the Main Line, the White House and finally got through the present himself and was asking for resources to help, you know, secure Kenosha and very impressed with that. Brian is a go-getter and a man of action. I like that about him and Blake that he demonstrated that that you know, he was willing to do that at all cost. So might you know, I'm very, very impressed and I just want to say nice job. Brian. I I know I shook your hand and told you that in person at the chicken burn, but I wanted to make that public as well. We need more people like that in the party that are willing to get proactive immediately and do what's right for the people of Wisconsin. No matter what. So, again to talk with you further. I know we didn't get a chance to talk too much at the chicken, burn your busy guy, but if you ever can make some time for me.Love to chat with you about economic specifically in the federal level. So what that hope everyone is doing well. Have a great day, and I'll talk to you later.

Even Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen warned Congress that “given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020, there will never be a peaceful transition of power.”  We are not going to stand by and let Trump destroy our Democracy.   That’s why Indivisible Action has joined forces with Stand Up America to launch Protect the Results — a broad coalition of grassroots organizations and patriotic activists working to build the infrastructure to mobilize Americans to take action in a post-election crisis scenario where Trump loses the election but refuses to concede.  This plan includes coalition building, game planning strategies for effective nationwide action, and running digital ads, all to make sure we’re prepared the moment the polls close on November 3rd.    The truth is this work costs money. We’re budgeting over $1.2 million between the ad buys, digital and data tools, staff time and expertise, event costs, and more.

This endorsement echoes how inclusive and diverse my platform is, and my term as your next State Representative for HD 173 will be. Mayor Pete pointed out the urgency to ensure our children receive a quality education. Our students have missed an enormous amount of instructional time since Hurricane Micheal in 2018 and the present-day COVID-19 Pandemic. My opponent voted to defund public education, which equated to $950 million during a crisis! Despite being almost 900 miles away, Mayor Buttigieg realizes that Georgia House District 173 needs an adaptable leader who will fight for our children and families first. Mayor Buttigieg also noted my push for Medicaid expansion. Expanding Medicaid would help our rural hospitals remain open, provide coverage to over 470,000 Georgians, revive our economy, and, most importantly, save lives! Decatur and Thomas county both have 15-20% of the state’s uninsured rate while Grady County has a whopping 20-25%. Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s endorsement shines a light on the ineffectiveness of the incumbent to deliver when we needed her the most. Furthermore, his approval highlights that we have a leader ready to lead District 173 out of the maze of mediocrity. That leader is Booker T. Gainor, your choice for House District 173.

Hello? How are you? I am so well, I am the biggest fan. I have been following you for forever. I love you. Today is a really special day because I got to you know, I'm going to cook with my mom later on and make some traditional food, which is like pupusas. Love I love. Point how do you eat them? What do you get them? Like usually well I do both vegetarian and with meet ya and then you know with the cabbage and then you know, I like salsa on the side. I like things hot be Conte so many countries and cultures have some version of it right where it's some version of kind of some kind of do that is has as the surprise yummy thing inside something spicy and if I may ask you like what  What are some of the commonalities that you think the Immigrant families have? I mean I have talked about my experiences, you know, being the eldest and right and and and watching my you know, five foot tall brown mother with an accent being you know, how she get treated. Yeah and from a very young age, you know, we all want to it's a a parent-child relationship is a very complicated.  Complex one but you know, we we as children want to protect our parents to write and and early in my life. You know, I knew that I wanted to make sure that no one would be treated that way whenever I see you talk to anybody and I feel like you know, my Angela would say I show up by myself, but I come with 10,000 I come 10,000 strong. That's how I feel when I see you. I'm like we are all there with you. We're all behind you like like here life brought you to like the river brought you like.  Here the river brought you just hear the river men, you know, and I'm like so excited that somebody who has had lived the life that you've lived who is representing so many of us is there and like which drank and power, you know to your point curly it also is I like I Mentor many people and things I remind people is that you and I and so many of us have had this experience over and over again. We're the only one like us in the room.  The thing that I always want to remind people of is exactly what you said, which is to remember when you walk in that room. We are all walking in there with you and so never feel alone and always know that that voice that you carry in that room is the voice of all of us and so chin up shoulders back and you speak with strength and Authority knowing that you are the voice of so many who are in that room with you even if you can't see us, right?  Yes, and I love that too because essentially I feel like a lot of us can show up in ways like by using our boat and that's how it's right. You know, like I wanted to know like why do you think voting is so important especially this year the reason to vote is because we must honor the ancestors that fought for our right to vote and those who fought to say that our voices are equal and equally important was about fighting for Criminal Justice Reform. It's about fighting for economic.  It and giving access to capital for Latino businesses and minority businesses. All of those issues are at stake right now fighting for the environment and environmental justice, right? These are the issues that are at stake. And then the last point I think that is equally important is let's never let anybody take our power from us. I agree. Right and proud of our part of our power is our ability to vote and when we vote in our numbers things change  Change we make a difference. Yeah, I find that when I talk to my cousin's I talk when I find it when I talk to a lot of different communities both in and outside of letting you dad. Sometimes you get the whole like well my vote doesn't count and I'm like, well, how do I tell my cousin? Yeah grow like your vote does count. Like let's go. Let's do it. Like do you have any advice on Mike? How do we get all the cousins to be like, but that's and all the cousins need to vote and the play cousins need to vote, too.  Yeah, right. Yeah, and so the thing is is that first of all, there are so many examples even in the last election for President. We're just you know hundreds or tens of thousands just 10,000 votes made a difference in the outcome of the race and we want everyone to go to Iowa vote.com to to make sure you know where that you're where you're registered to vote and where you can vote and if you can vote early we really want you to vote.  Utterly, it's also like a thing where a lot of people our age like, we're like, where do we go? Where do we find summation? How do we know that what we're reading? We can trust and I think that having a website that we can go to you for all of the information that's not just there but it's also accessible and information that we can take in. I think that's a super great resource. I'm really thankful that this exists because even for me like I'm like, I'm pretty smart, but sometimes I'm like, what does this mean? You know, well, we all need a little help.  Man, if I may introduce you to my mom super yes, please we were making people's eyes today and it's kind of like a traditional thing that was passed on from her mother to well her great her grandmother to her mother to her. And so now her and all her sisters make it and now I'm currently my mom's also like super shy but I'm no let me see Hi, how are you? I wish I  as in your kitchen with you or how long is it going to take you to make them actually always say maybe 15 to 20 minutes. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you just go in and you go and you have all that flour and all and then you doing meat and vegetables are what are you doing? You know, I just don't like kissing beans. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, do they said go. I think I made.  Your mouth zucchini. Oh, no. Oh, no. Wow, and then you make the pork ahead of time, right? You probably slow cook that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's nice. You know, I couldn't sleep for a week.  I'm honored to meet you and to talk with you and hopefully we can all see each other in person in Allah and yeah, yeah, it's very nice to see you and enjoy cooking with your son. It's one of the best things is to cook with your mother. It's one of the the greatest things in the world is to be able to cook with your mother. So thank you very much. Enjoy letting me join in this experience. Even for this moment. Thank you. Thank you. Whew, that was that was so exciting.  And I don't even know if I'll be able to focus on making posters with my mom, but that's what we're here for. So let's do this. So what you do is grab a little bit of the math lab you roll it up into a tiny ball and then you start to open it up almost like a little dumpling and then you slowly start to fill it in with a different feeling. So whether that's pretty hilarious or teach a drone or Kissel which is beans cheese and pork you can mix it in and then you start to flatten it out the best part the fun part and kind of like the most iconic part about cooking pupusas.  Is the hand movements and then they throw it on what we usually use is like a cool mod. And Uncle Mike can be anything. It can be like a Go - like a traditional school that we use in the kitchen. But if you have a pan at home, or you have anything that will kind of give you the same effect throw it on there. Nothing. I've been I don't be afraid to not have the tools just do it the best way that you can the important part is that we definitely want to share the Traditions passed them on and allow people to enjoy food.

Welcome to the show Jon najarian John a good to see you an interview you here Daniela. It's my pleasure. I'm looking forward to it. And it looks like it's a little windy where you are judging by the trees behind right now Munch y'all still Montreal before I head back out to the u.s. John but happy  to speak with you today because obviously volatile times we are living in here and want to get your thoughts on the comments made by Fed chair Powell earlier this week pretty concerning here saying that we are could be headed to economic tragedy if the u.s. Can't get the covid-19 a situation on track here. Well, and I think he while he was saying that to certainly you're right Daniela I what what I was taking away from it was  Also that we really need Congress to do something in other words. I think the FED has done about as much as they can do they'll keep trying to do things. But we really need something out of the Congress similar to the cares act and whether or not they can get that done before the election. I hope they can we've heard virtually every member of the feds say that we need that I think we do.  I looked at an article just today Daniela that said in May a hundred thousand businesses in the United States had closed permanently in May and that was when we had some of the payroll protection as well as the unenhanced unemployment benefit. We need both of those again. We probably don't need the $1200 per household sort of checks, you know up to a certain level of wage earner, but we definitely need  The enhanced unemployment and I think the payroll protection. Otherwise we're going to see another hundred thousand places permanently closed their doors and that'll mean the recovery when it comes will be very tepid much like it was in 2009. So a concentrated effort to save small business John. Yes, exactly. I'm not worried about Apple. I'm not worried about most big companies, but I am worried about all the little  On pawn shops and just like its consumers that really lifts the economy here in the United States. They're close to 70 percent of GDP. We need the small businesses because without them all the people, they employ all the people they service it'll be a much different America for the next three to five years if we let 200 or 250 thousand businesses die just because we're beat playing  X and John in his message to Congress if we read between the lines there is he basically seeing where an environment of QE Infinity? Yeah, I think he is and yes, we're going to keep rates low for a long time. Although as we've seen over the past week. Even when the FED is keeping rates at or near zero the 10% are the 10 year bond rather has made a pretty dramatic move and the TLT which is an ETF.  The tracks Bond movement has dropped rather dramatically after not having moved at all. I mean but we just saw a drop from I think about 164 to 158 in the last little bit for that TLT and we see a lot of speculation from Big institutions that it'll go lower than that. It might even Plum down to about 150. So John, how are you positioning yourself here ahead of the  And in terms of sex sectors your liking right now and how will that change given the outcome of the election? I think either way these pixel do well, I think the infrastructure picks. So in other words Goldfield GV some XCX, those are two examples of some of the stocks that we're really looking at hard right now as far as you know providing cement for  Are roads some X as well as building of course and GV, which is an infrastructure play all over the board gold Fields. It's not a gold miner, right? But that's the name nonetheless. That would be either President Trump or President Biden. If it is President Biden, I think you could concentrate even more so on green energy in other words. I don't know that Elon Musk needs the Boost  Tesla's still do fine. But SunPower spw are probably a number of non fracking plays. In other words. I might even be long solar and short fracking because I would anticipate that even though he hasn't said that he's going to shut fracking down. He's already said no new permits for frackers. And so I understand why he hasn't come out hard against it because if he  Does he loses Ohio and Texas and Pennsylvania votes? Maybe he doesn't lose those States Daniela, but obviously those are significant states that are involved in fracking. I don't think either candidate can afford to lose those. So not surprisingly neither one wants to come out against fracking. What do you do with a stock like apple here John? They're not seeing they may release a new iPhone any time now, right and we're thinking both of us. I think next week. They've just made the announcement.  In April, October 13th, sorry and I think a5g iPhones a big deal. It's not just because it's a little bit faster because it is only really a little bit faster for most of us. We wouldn't notice very much how much faster it is, but for applications like GPS, it'll be much better for applications like self-driving cars Daniela. It'll be absolutely necessary. So I think  Apple's going to do just fine, but I don't think that this is one you want to step out of in other words as much as I say infrastructure and some value stocks have Biden wins. I think either way just like those infrastructure plays Apple wins because we're all Apple junkies and those of us that can afford it will buy that new iPhone as soon as it comes out John finally. How about the safe haven plays? What can we expect?  From metals like gold, I think as long as the FED is as active as they're likely to be for the next three to five years gold probably gets into the 2200 to the Ounce range not right away. But over the next year, I would look for about a 10 percent appreciation or a little bit more as far as silver and platinum. I think they do well also Bitcoin and  related coins that are of limited Supply rather than Unlimited Supply coins. I think those will do very well as well because I think Europe and the United States are likely to keep the pedal to the metal as far as keep rates below zero or near zero in one of those two cases Jon najarian. I appreciate your your comments and thoughts today. Finally. I know you've been involved in many things. What are you up to these days? What do you really focusing on? Um,  I actually am involved with a couple of cryptocurrency boards. I'm involved in a couple of companies that do digital printing or I'm on the board of black Buffalo. It's a privately held company based in Korea that does large-scale printing of when we say like this kind of printing printing houses imagine that like these guys their machines are as big as  as mostly as big as a small house your tummy. You can make me a two-door garage and print it. Yeah. Wow, just print it out. I mean the things that these guys did, you know Apple used, of course this technology to make a lot of the prototypes that they were making years and years ago and now it's moved all the way into construction. And so that's an area I'm focused on as well because you can make things really fast.  And do it right there on site. So the transportation is not the issue and it's not the issue with Home Depot or anything else. It's really wild stuff fascinating wild indeed Jon najarian. Thank you so much for joining us.

Let's really sit down and talk about what we learned, you know, take some time to analyze the policy disagreements think through the important issues pass the nuances of the question is yes is the radical left. Will you shut up this and you graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. This is so good.  Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged. That's not true. Is it to talkin use? Wait a minute, you get the final word know it's hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me. This a let me just tell you there's nothing smart about Yu-Gi-Oh 47 years. You've done nothing. I fear the worst America has ever had. Oh snap. These guys were bickering so much Canada call the cops to complain about the noise. I have never seen a debate like that in my life.  To be honest, I've never seen anything like that in my life. Honestly, it's it seemed less like a presidential debate and more like a fight that you over here in a booth at Denny's while you shut up you clown you got no class. I got no class you got terrible grades and your son's a cocaine you piece of shit. You don't talk about my son you listen. Yeah. I like could I get the moons over my hammy with the orange juice, please? Yeah, that'll be  Adult thank you so much. You got drunk and you here on your own daughter. I wasn't drunk. I mean some of these insults will way more personal than you ever seen a debate. Especially Biden calling Trump a clown which guys I'm sorry, man is that's not fair to Trump. All right clowns. We're weird makeup. They have clothes that are too big for them. They're deeply sad even when they don't show it. Does that sound like Donald Trump to you now, let's just be clear the reason that this debate.  Eight was such a colossal train wreck is because Donald J. Trump was throwing grenades on the tracks and usually in a debate the moderators there to prevent things from getting out of hand, but last night's water rates a Chris Wallace was about a successful at stopping Trump as the popular vote. The country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I'm appealing to you sir to do that. Well and him too. Well frankly. You've been doing more interrupting. That's it.  And we will press have people that I'm the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer. Yes, sir. I understand you've agreed to the two minutes. So please let him have a sure you made it you made a point but an answer and there mr. President. I the answer the second subject is covid-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let's try to be serious about it true. You're doing it you're going to have a true gentleman is  I hate to raise my voice to me. Why shouldn't I be different than the two of you? So you've been talking to me this statement? I'm asking you I would love to know I would love to you know, if you want to switch seats, we could very quickly we can do that. Oh man, that is so sad. Trump was being such a child that Chris Wallace actually had to pull the do you want to switch seats move that English teachers use with their students and honestly, I'm glad that Trump didn't take him up on it because if Trump takes  Wallace's job then Wallace has to take over Trump's job. And I don't know if he has it in him to kill 200,000 people. But seriously though, I feel bad for Chris Wallace any moderator in a trump debate is basically a WWE ref, you know rarely stopping anyone you just there to get body-slammed every once in a while and people have been criticizing Wallace for how he handled the debate, but honestly guys, I don't know if another model rates are could have done better. I mean whether you like it or not Trump is the president of the United States, so what was Wallace?  Supposed to do ground him. There was no way to stop Trump last night. He interrupted Biden. He interrupted Wallace and there weren't any commercials last night. But if they were Trump would have interrupted those two guys. Are you tired of frequent nighttime bathroom trips will force back your prostate. Why is it just out of curiosity? He mayor of Moscow as wife gave you son three and a half million dollars, I guess relentless.  So look, this was not a Shining Moment In the American history books, right political observers refer to it as a shitshow a dumpster fire the worst debate in history and with all the interrupting and cross talking it might have even been hard to remember if anything important happened last night, but there was one moment that really stood out. Are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacist and militia groups and to say  That they need to stand down and not add to the violence and a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we've seen in Portland, I'm willing to do anything. I want to see people do it, sir. Do it say do you want to call him? What do you want to call him? Give me a name. Give me my surprise and right problem ISIS stand back and stand by but I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right way.  A problem is wow. There you have it folks Trump had an opportunity to be like white supremacist. I don't quit you instead. He's like stand by guys. I never know when I'm going to need you telling white supremacists to stand down and telling them to stand by are not the same thing. All right, that one little word makes a huge difference like the difference between a blowout and a blow job. Do not ask for the wrong one at Supercuts.  Again to the staff at Supercuts. I apologize. I hadn't slept and I didn't read the menu properly and even for that non condemnation Trump had to be dragged into it like no President should have have to be pressured this hard into condemning white supremacist. It's the easiest thing Trump did it so grudgingly. He was like one of those guys who refuses to make real apologies what I'm supposed to apologize for tailgating at your dad's funeral fine. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you're unable to have a good.  Time some of us are still living. And by the way, you know that you've truly botched your condemnation of a hate group. When that hate group says thank you for the endorsement. The proud boy is a far-right extremist group immediately celebrating the president's comments on social media. They went nuts on social media celebrating. They put out those words as a rallying cry stand back stand by within minutes. The group's members were posting on private social.  Are calling Trump's comments quote historic the New York Times reports that some group members labeled it as a tacit endorsement of their violent tactics while another posted the group is already seeing a spike in new recruits. Yes. Thanks to Donald Trump's failed condemnation. This hate group is now seeing an increase in recruits, which means in the history of Television that might be one of the worst answers ever given  And that's coming from someone who wants guess the number seven on Wheel of Fortune. I didn't know it had to be letters. That was like I was new to America the prop boys liked Donald Trump's answer so much that they even adopting it as their new slogan and that actually might piss off Trump because the one thing he definitely believes in is getting royalties. Well, nobody should be advocating the supremacy of the white man without giving Danny he's cut I'd be careful if I were the problems though because if there's one thing we know about Donald Trump, is that once he invests in you you about  Five years until you go bankrupt. So yes in a debate that consisted almost entirely of three old men trying to shout over each other. This one moment was horrifying enough to break out and get noticed and you know, it's bad when even Trump's own supporters are left saying you're done up the president. Well, he would not condemn white supremacists. I agree that the president made of made a bad error and not take that was a huge gaps. He was he was  Kind of like playing around. I didn't like that he equivocated when he could have slam dunk bat picking this book up if he should correct it because it corrected. I guess he didn't miss me Donald Trump grew the biggest lay up in the history of debates by saying not condemning white supremacist. I don't know if he didn't hear it, but he's got to clarify that right away. That's like are you against evil why the president didn't just knocked out of the park. I'm not sure. Yes.  Why didn't the president condemned white supremacy? Hmm? It's a real mystery. Maybe he didn't hear the question. Or maybe he misspoke. Or maybe he thought they said Sprite supremacists and he's really into Sprite. I can't think of any other explanation Watson. By the way. Did you notice that even when Fox people acknowledge Trump did something really bad? They still give him the benefit of the doubt. I wish I had friends that were that loyal, you know, if I shat my pants and  Like none of my friends would be like Trevor didn't shit himself his but misspoke. Look Trump's friends can play dumb about this all they want but I don't know why I don't know at this point. People are still acting surprised when he refuses to denounce white supremacists because as you may remember this is not exactly a new thing for him. I think there's blame on both sides. You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were  very fine people on both sides Rising threat. I don't really there are white supremacist groups and individuals like that who support you some of whom you've even retweeted. Well that I know nothing about I mean, I don't know about retweeting. I mean you retweet somebody and turns out to be a white supremacist. I know nothing about these groups that are supporting me. Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don't want his Vote or that of other white supremacists in this election. I don't know anything about  David Duke, okay. I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I have to look if you would send me a list of the groups. I will do research on them. And certainly I would disavow of I thought there was something wrong, but you may have questions in there that are totally fine and it would be very unfair. So give me a list of the groups and I'll let you know. Okay, I mean, I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but I don't know it honestly. I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I've ever met.  Met him I pretty sure I didn't meet him and I just don't know anything about them. Yeah, it's actually hard to keep track of all the times that Trump had the chance to be anti-racist and didn't the only thing he avoids more than condemning white supremacist is paying taxes and keep in mind. This is the same guy who has strong opinions on everything. I mean the man tweeted for a month about Robert Pattinson's love like Robert Pattinson AKA Twilight, but then when it comes to white supremacy, he's like, hey, man, I don't get involved in other people's business.  As you know, you do your own thing. The truth is people sometimes not having an opinion is having an opinion if someone's like I don't know some Urban London, so I'm not going to say anything bad about him and you should stop talking to that person or at least don't get on a plane with them. So look I get why his supporters want to act like Trump's proud boys moment last night was some kind of accidental or unintentional Gaff, but if you see someone making the same mistake over,  Over and over again why some point you have to accept that? It's not a mistake. It's their belief. The Daily Show Comedy Central  Trump Stands By White Supremacists In Debate ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Wanted to pursue God's word. It's important to keep in mind when you're thinking about what it takes to make America great again, but the key element is spiritual not secular many will say well, this is not a Christian Nation, but  IE everything that the founders did had to do with Biblical principles and when you move away from those and landmarks and those foundations now you going to the Bible clearly says matter of fact if the foundation's be destroyed what can the righteous do so when you destroy foundations you destroy the under pending of what you were built upon and so we've got to make sure that we restore those kinds of attitudes back in America.

Do I have permission to record this call? Yes, you do. Looks like you were looking at running has recall effort, correct? So I am a finance economic. I also have to do some trading on Wall Street. A lot different contacts within many different Industries and I've been following politics for the last ten years and I didn't like, what I was seeing coming down the Horizon. And I also didn't really wasn't comfortable with the leadership currently that I saw cute up for the GOP. Neither side, really Republican or Democrat, and I really care about my state. It's, it's home to me. I love it. And the people are great and they just don't deserve, you know, this terrible leadership that we have and all the suffering. He knows everyone's going through, especially now. And so, I know, you know, I, I, I feel, I had a strategy on the right plan to get us back on our feet and moving again. And that's why I stepped in the race. Correct. unsatisfied with the current leadership, we have Like specifically would you like to see the Constitution? How there's a lot of advice, but first of all, first one would be the excessive lockdowns. I had a real problem with that. I believe that each individual adult should be able to decide how they want to do, you know, protect themselves and their health, not have the government mandate to them, what they can and cannot do. And I understand that we were under the pretense of a global pandemic, which we are now realizing that actually wasn't the case. And I don't really want to have to pay too much about that. But my sources have showed early on that. The severity of covid-19 was not as high of a threat level, as a mainstream media outlets for train it to be. So, how was fine with the initial two-week? Lockdown was kind of see what's going on. But after that, and started ragging on, I realized that there was something more nefarious to it, and it felt like the policy that one place were really benefiting the multinational, big corporations, your Amazon, your Walmart, but is very strict on the small and medium-sized business owner. They had to really shut down for the whole Thanks, and I was really kind of yellow top of my lungs. Like if we hold any longer. We're going to lose a lot of bit small business and a lot of jobs and a lot of livelihoods are going to be destroyed and I didn't think I didn't think the risk in all risk reward ratio there from locking down to how many people are going to lose income then maybe their homes with was a good trade-off. So I said it's time to open up the economy housing as and within the mist of the crisis. So I was actually leading out early on with in it even though you know, I wasn't even you know, quite a Kennedy. I was already thinking about it. I start speaking on my Facebook and that's how I was some people started following me. Given your views on the shutdown. What do you think of the right? So, that was the next one? I was, I've been a poet. I've been opposed to the mask mandate from from day one. And again, I understand that if you own a private business, it is your choice. I know how you want to operate that, but I am doing some hunting. I realized there wasn't really a business owners Choice with the mask mandate Department of Health, and the man and them, you know, the decree, if you will come in from ebers, that was leveraging their business license. And so they don't want to lose their business license and get shut down by the government. Therefore, they were forced to comply and the other thing and I really didn't like, was that business owners and their staff had to cut up, start policing the customers themselves, you know, it's kind of relationship in a way from customers that didn't want to wear a mask from the place that they like to go and frequent do business. They want to support that business place, but now, it's just something they couldn't do, you know, so even myself. I don't, I don't wear a mask. I haven't wore masks from day one. Unfortunately, I have not been able to go to all the businesses and restaurants that I used to love going to because of that. Why did you decide not to do it? Sure, there's there's many reasons, but the main one is, I believe and the immune system, the god designed Us in his infinite wisdom and we have a powerful immune system. I felt there wasn't enough attention going into. How do we, how do you boost your immune system to protect from this virus? And we just all this emphasis was placed on this mask and it was the first was in the right kind of mask, you know, and if people were just throwing anything around their face thinking that they were protecting themselves and others and it's just getting ridiculous. And so, at some point I realized that this was kind of like the emperor has no clothes moment, you know, and then you go into somebody stores and even the gym. Now, you see these people and they got it down by their chin and it's like does a virus really wait for, you know, you're at your mass to be down before it comes out. I mean, you know, we have it their nose Xbox, they're not even wearing a properly so it's not doing anyone. Any good. So, you know, the virus is still being spread fear ready? Right. So what is this whole Mass nonsense then why they keep forcing this issue. What's happening covid-19? It was, it was inaccurate to to declare a global pandemic. I have a few items. I'm sure you've checked out. My my YouTube video channel. I have a lot of video education material that I put out there and explain how, you know, my reasons for everything. But listen to people who are at high risk, for always going to be at risk of catching something the elderly, write the immunocompromised. I did. I am totally on board hate. If they want to go ahead and sit and self quarantine and isolate and do what I need to do to protect themself. I'm all for it. But to shut down, you know, the other 96, 97 per-cent of the population, just didn't make any sense to me. So again, it felt very much like a top again. Then we saw dr. Fauci. And all the inconsistencies that we're coming out from the onow, a hand with the CDC and in the who he was all over the place, you know, it's so if this is government and they're supposed to be the expert, So smart and letting us know what to do. Well in my opinion they got an upgrade on this whole thing. The recall the governor and have you been involved at all? And I'm not been involved in the effort for the recall know it took me by surprise. I also did a video on my response to that. I was calling, you know personally before I was in a kind of like we need to recall 2020 either cuz I just I think is in way over his head. He is definitely not a leader. We we saw that with the whole Kenosha incident. So yeah, I don't think he's a good leader, especially now and when all the challenges that we have to deal with from job loss of jobs, write a high unemployment, the economy, but he's not a businessman. So doesn't understand. Don't think he's ever created one job in his life. So he's not going to know how to help dig Wisconsin out of this deep hole. Find you or did you think of the recall effort? I think there's a I think a lot of people are doing the recall because I am a candidate. Honestly, I think there's a lot of people that I have been dissatisfied with the in action from the Republican party. I know from my own podcast and the following and they're in the radio interviews. I think probably half a million people know who I am now in the state of Wisconsin based on my at my estimates, you know, I think they're excited about who I am and no, other candidate has laid out a detailed plan it before all the public to see it looks like like I said before, I bring em about transparency and of course, I'm a technology guy, I think government you, so you can go get upgraded in the 21st century here. With the way we're running at the infant, you know, is so inefficient and there's so there's really had to take time out on your own. Watch there and go check out my Wisconsin voice app technology videos. I think it would be pretty impressed with what I'm trying to do because I'm trying to get big money out of politics. So it's fair for people who want to come in a coming from a position. They have the best ideas, not just how much money they can spend on advertisements. And I know this was a big issue with the recall where they're saying. Oh, well, Tony Burton reads on limited funds. I say, who cares? Who cares? If him and Joe, Biden spent 50 million dollars in, advertisements. If you've already made up your mind that he's done a terrible job and he has not protected the people, Wisconsin. You're not going to vote for him because you're seeing is add 100 times a day. I have and you know, I'm here to bring peace to the state under a peaceful guy. Even though I've done martial arts for 12 years. I've never engaged in one fight because my scent they told me that the moment you fight you've lost because you should be able to settle any dispute with your words, right? And so I'm from the small short video clip that I did see. And that's the problem with mainstream media and everyone has Neil cell phone cameras now, so if someone takes a video of this and that's just one perspective that we get. Unfortunately. The mainstream media takes it and they run with it and then everyone just, you know, looks at that video and assume that's exactly how it played out. I am fully back the badge and law enforcement. Can we improve our processes shark should come out Kenosha officers. It had the body cameras. Yes, I think so. I think we're leaving a day and age would like, like I said, how many smart phones are out there? The police need to always have a body cam on down there person, you know. That's just standard. Now. I don't think we can get away from that but no, it and regards to dict. He should have complied and and just go along with what the office requested him to do. There's that we don't have a complete picture. I agree. We just have that 20 when you have a couple videos from somewhere. Yeah, I mean, that's that's up to the jury to decide. I mean, you know, in the end of testimonies of the officers, right? That's the problem again, is we, we know the media gives us that and we become to judge, you know, during execution of a person, whether they're guilty or innocent. And I don't think that's, that's right, and I don't know how this country was set up. Did you think of that and the police respond to the governor's response to it? Won't we got a first talked about what it means to protest cuz I think I have a very different definition of that word during the excessive lockdown to and I personally went and protested in Brookfield Wisconsin peacefully were on the sidewalks with all their signs. We were and we did not like the excessive lockdown 2020 vs doing that. But you know, the cops were there, their they're coming by, we're waving out of them and no trouble, not one incident, right? So what happened in Kenosha, you know, and I want them all together. I understand there are people that are they protesting, and what they want. They want you no justice at Justice and fairness and face their tiresome people get killed. I understand. I don't want that either, but unfortunately, the media doesn't focus on those p. The protest. The only focus on an amp up, the ones that are destroying property and lighting building's on fire. Right? So the other thing is to It really it was right. Right. Exactly. As we now know, a lot of these people are actually not from actually with in Kenosha. They're from out of state or you know, different parts of the state, right. So their pocket or so they come in and he started to start things up and people assume. That's really the, you know, how how the people of Kenosha responding to an event and that's not really the case at all. The police officers, boy, you know, they got overwhelmed there and they definitely need a backup from a National Guard. And with a big problem. I had to think we're 20 verse really suck himself as the pr statement that he put out so quickly after the incident, it felt like he was Riley things up, and almost was on the side of the, the looters, right? Of the vandalism, and all the burning. So so that was not, that was not smart. That's not, that's not good leadership there. But then again, he delayed and dragged us video for another day or so. Before finally Brian Style. The president was able to get us more National Guard resources there. Guide. You know, again, I don't I don't really like to comment on something that I don't have all the details to. I don't want him to be swayed by my opinion on this, right? But you know from what I can tell her what I've heard is he technically live out of state? I wasn't even sure if his family or them had property or business in out in Kenosha. Maybe you can tell me whatever, you know if they had. Okay. Yeah. So here's what's happening is enough again. I personally, I don't think you should have been there at all in the first place. I will need to let the other trained professionals and law enforcement, you know, handle these situations. I'm there so much legality that goes into this, you know, if somebody was to get hurt or shot, you know what that is citizen, don't have the same kind of protection. So, you know, by the same time and I know what you were feeling like, hey, there's not enough resources, being allocated here to protect our property and our buildings. We had just made me start taking things into her own hands and didn't defend it, you know, and that's where that's kind of the boiling point that we're getting to that. So dangerous and a good leader, would be able to deescalate this and bring a peaceful resolution to it instead of people real Lock and Load. And he know their home guns and before, you know, it might just be in a civil war, right? And everyone shooting everyone, and I don't think anyone wants that to happen. What's the time in touch with you yesterday. I think President Trump came because he actually cared and Joe Biden's doing it. Because, well, he has to know the political issue, right? I was very impressed with the press conference that that person. And, yeah, I think it was. I think it's, it's handled exactly how it should handle. Just a little too late, unfortunately, and that's all the blame again on 20 years for them. Most policies. I am. I'm just waiting for him to figure out how to rein in the Federal Reserve in Central Banking. Because that's actually the pillar that's going to damage the most people, the most Americans with it within the country due to the excessive printing of money. Yeah, it does to me. You know what I'd like. I said, I, I watched it for many years and I I feel both parties are kind of guilty of things in their own ways. And I think with Republican party is, is there just a little bit stagnant right there. A little little stale their, their, their, their family to move, you know, Blitzen. If a Republican party supposed to be on the side of the Constitution. Then like I said in my recall video, you know, there's a timer in place and he is doing things that is clearly anti-American and unconstitutional, right? Then we need to check them. When you take me to get rid of them. They're no good. Time in the Republic, guys are all wait, two years and then we'll see what happens. We will wait and see what's what happens. No, no, no, no. No. That kind of apathy has brought the country to where it is today. So that's that's my take on it. Yeah, the reason for that type of leaf is like a, like a sad young peace. Party is a machine and there's Milly multi millions of dollars that flow through it, and there is an inside club, right? So for some people within it, they have the wink and Nod that it's their turn to become governor because they did their time and, you know, whatever the name I ask them. So, when else are like me, who comes in with some fresh ideas, powerful ideas, actually and looks to shake things up. Really like that so much. I don't, I don't know. I have my own suspicions, but I can't say any until it's neon. They declare. So what do you do? Unless there's some kind of misconduct. What you share that to you that because you be used sparingly. I think that you were sick. Yeah, I believe we have misconduct this time and and if people real people lost their lives under this current recall, an Endeavor, right? I wouldn't, I'm not aware of anyone dying under the last recall, for the last recall from me. Do my research understanding was really based on some some balanced budget issues, right? We had some stomach. Yep unions. So yeah, so it was very different scenario here. See what I did wrong to Warrant that. So he wanted to balance the state budget. And this is the individuals were required to balance out our own budgets. Right? We don't get off the hook for that. But for some reason governments don't have to do that. They can spend, you know, forever and ever and ever. And Walker was finally at, you know, someone that's okay. And not feel that we have to balance the budget and he hadn't had to make the tough choices to do so and that's what he did. Social Security. Yeah, there's a lot of people ask my opinion on that and so it like you said, that is a federal program. So that was just more of an educational video. Nothing. I should really have any control over but I put it out there for people to understand why a social security is in trouble. Why is already been depleted and how much is going to be a further burden on the younger generation. If we keep the program that exact same way it is today. It's the point that I want to do. By this weekend, it's been. Okay. That's great. I appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time. All right. Take care of Patrick.

He has repeatedly taken over YouTube's entire homepage. The campaign claims to have half a billion video views over the last four months alone.

And that's why I stepped in the race. Correct. unsatisfied with the current leadership, we have Like specifically would you like to see the Constitution? How there's a lot of advice, but first of all, first one would be the excessive lockdowns. I had a real problem with that. I believe that each individual adult should be able to decide how they want to do, you know, protect themselves and their health, not have the government mandate to them, what they can and cannot do. And I understand that we were under the pretense of a global pandemic, which we are now realizing that actually wasn't the case. And I don't really want to have to pay too much about that. But my sources have showed early on that. The severity of covid-19 was not as high of a threat level, as a mainstream media outlets for train it to be. So, how was fine with the initial two-week? Lockdown was kind of see what's going on. But after that, and started ragging on, I realized that there was something more nefarious to it, and it felt like the policy that one place were really benefiting the multinational, big corporations, your Amazon, your Walmart, but is very strict on the small and medium-sized business owner. They had to really shut down for the whole Thanks, and I was really kind of yellow top of my lungs. Like if we hold any longer. We're going to lose a lot of bit small business and a lot of jobs and a lot of livelihoods are going to be destroyed and I didn't think I didn't think the risk in all risk reward ratio there from locking down to how many people are going to lose income then maybe their homes with was a good trade-off. So I said it's time to open up the economy housing as and within the mist of the crisis. So I was actually leading out early on with in it even though you know, I wasn't even you know, quite a Kennedy. I was already thinking about it. I start speaking on my Facebook and that's how I was some people started following me. Given your views on the shutdown. What do you think of the right? So, that was the next one? I was, I've been a poet. I've been opposed to the mask mandate from from day one. And again, I understand that if you own a private business, it is your choice. I know how you want to operate that, but I am doing some hunting. I realized there wasn't really a business owners Choice with the mask mandate Department of Health, and the man and them, you know, the decree, if you will come in from ebers, that was leveraging their business license. And so they don't want to lose their business license and get shut down by the government. Therefore, they were forced to comply and the other thing and I really didn't like, was that business owners and their staff had to cut up, start policing the customers themselves, you know, it's kind of relationship in a way from customers that didn't want to wear a mask from the place that they like to go and frequent do business. They want to support that business place, but now, it's just something they couldn't do, you know, so even myself. I don't, I don't wear a mask. I haven't wore masks from day one. Unfortunately, I have not been able to go to all the businesses and restaurants that I used to love going to because of that. Why did you decide not to do it? Sure, there's there's many reasons, but the main one is, I believe and the immune system, the god designed Us in his infinite wisdom and we have a powerful immune system. I felt there wasn't enough attention going into. How do we, how do you boost your immune system to protect from this virus? And we just all this emphasis was placed on this mask and it was the first was in the right kind of mask, you know, and if people were just throwing anything around their face thinking that they were protecting themselves and others and it's just getting ridiculous. And so, at some point I realized that this was kind of like the emperor has no clothes moment, you know, and then you go into somebody stores and even the gym. Now, you see these people and they got it down by their chin and it's like does a virus really wait for, you know, you're at your mass to be down before it comes out. I mean, you know, we have it their nose Xbox, they're not even wearing a properly so it's not doing anyone. Any good. So, you know, the virus is still being spread fear ready? Right. So what is this whole Mass nonsense then why they keep forcing this issue. What's happening covid-19? It was, it was inaccurate to to declare a global pandemic. I have a few items. I'm sure you've checked out. My my YouTube video channel. I have a lot of video education material that I put out there and explain how, you know, my reasons for everything. But listen to people who are at high risk, for always going to be at risk of catching something the elderly, write the immunocompromised. I did. I am totally on board hate. If they want to go ahead and sit and self quarantine and isolate and do what I need to do to protect themself. I'm all for it. But to shut down, you know, the other 96, 97 per-cent of the population, just didn't make any sense to me. So again, it felt very much like a top again. Then we saw dr. Fauci. And all the inconsistencies that we're coming out from the onow, a hand with the CDC and in the who he was all over the place, you know, it's so if this is government and they're supposed to be the expert, So smart and letting us know what to do. Well in my opinion they got an upgrade on this whole thing. The recall the governor and have you been involved at all? And I'm not been involved in the effort for the recall know it took me by surprise. I also did a video on my response to that. I was calling, you know personally before I was in a kind of like we need to recall 2020 either cuz I just I think is in way over his head. He is definitely not a leader. We we saw that with the whole Kenosha incident. So yeah, I don't think he's a good leader, especially now and when all the challenges that we have to deal with from job loss of jobs, write a high unemployment, the economy, but he's not a businessman. So doesn't understand. Don't think he's ever created one job in his life. So he's not going to know how to help dig Wisconsin out of this deep hole. Find you or did you think of the recall effort? I think there's a I think a lot of people are doing the recall because I am a candidate. Honestly, I think there's a lot of people that I have been dissatisfied with the in action from the Republican party. I know from my own podcast and the following and they're in the radio interviews. I think probably half a million people know who I am now in the state of Wisconsin based on my at my estimates, you know, I think they're excited about who I am and no, other candidate has laid out a detailed plan it before all the public to see it looks like like I said before, I bring em about transparency and of course, I'm a technology guy, I think government you, so you can go get upgraded in the 21st century here. With the way we're running at the infant, you know, is so inefficient and there's so there's really had to take time out on your own. Watch there and go check out my Wisconsin voice app technology videos. I think it would be pretty impressed with what I'm trying to do because I'm trying to get big money out of politics. So it's fair for people who want to come in a coming from a position. They have the best ideas, not just how much money they can spend on advertisements. And I know this was a big issue with the recall where they're saying. Oh, well, Tony Burton reads on limited funds. I say, who cares? Who cares? If him and Joe, Biden spent 50 million dollars in, advertisements. If you've already made up your mind that he's done a terrible job and he has not protected the people, Wisconsin. You're not going to vote for him because you're seeing is add 100 times a day. I have and you know, I'm here to bring peace to the state under a peaceful guy. Even though I've done martial arts for 12 years. I've never engaged in one fight because my scent they told me that the moment you fight you've lost because you should be able to settle any dispute with your words, right? And so I'm from the small short video clip that I did see. And that's the problem with mainstream media and everyone has Neil cell phone cameras now, so if someone takes a video of this and that's just one perspective that we get. Unfortunately. The mainstream media takes it and they run with it and then everyone just, you know, looks at that video and assume that's exactly how it played out. I am fully back the badge and law enforcement. Can we improve our processes shark should come out Kenosha officers. It had the body cameras. Yes, I think so. I think we're leaving a day and age would like, like I said, how many smart phones are out there? The police need to always have a body cam on down there person, you know. That's just standard. Now. I don't think we can get away from that but no, it and regards to dict. He should have complied and and just go along with what the office requested him to do. There's that we don't have a complete picture. I agree. We just have that 20 when you have a couple videos from somewhere. Yeah, I mean, that's that's up to the jury to decide. I mean, you know, in the end of testimonies of the officers, right? That's the problem again, is we, we know the media gives us that and we become to judge, you know, during execution of a person, whether they're guilty or innocent. And I don't think that's, that's right, and I don't know how this country was set up. Did you think of that and the police respond to the governor's response to it? Won't we got a first talked about what it means to protest cuz I think I have a very different definition of that word during the excessive lockdown to and I personally went and protested in Brookfield Wisconsin peacefully were on the sidewalks with all their signs. We were and we did not like the excessive lockdown 2020 vs doing that. But you know, the cops were there, their they're coming by, we're waving out of them and no trouble, not one incident, right? So what happened in Kenosha, you know, and I want them all together. I understand there are people that are they protesting, and what they want. They want you no justice at Justice and fairness and face their tiresome people get killed. I understand. I don't want that either, but unfortunately, the media doesn't focus on those p. The protest. The only focus on an amp up, the ones that are destroying property and lighting building's on fire. Right? So the other thing is to It really it was right. Right. Exactly. As we now know, a lot of these people are actually not from actually with in Kenosha. They're from out of state or you know, different parts of the state, right. So their pocket or so they come in and he started to start things up and people assume. That's really the, you know, how how the people of Kenosha responding to an event and that's not really the case at all. The police officers, boy, you know, they got overwhelmed there and they definitely need a backup from a National Guard. And with a big problem. I had to think we're 20 verse really suck himself as the pr statement that he put out so quickly after the incident, it felt like he was Riley things up, and almost was on the side of the, the looters, right? Of the vandalism, and all the burning. So so that was not, that was not smart. That's not, that's not good leadership there. But then again, he delayed and dragged us video for another day or so. Before finally Brian Style. The president was able to get us more National Guard resources there. Guide. You know, again, I don't I don't really like to comment on something that I don't have all the details to. I don't want him to be swayed by my opinion on this, right? But you know from what I can tell her what I've heard is he technically live out of state? I wasn't even sure if his family or them had property or business in out in Kenosha. Maybe you can tell me whatever, you know if they had. Okay. Yeah. So here's what's happening is enough again. I personally, I don't think you should have been there at all in the first place. I will need to let the other trained professionals and law enforcement, you know, handle these situations. I'm there so much legality that goes into this, you know, if somebody was to get hurt or shot, you know what that is citizen, don't have the same kind of protection. So, you know, by the same time and I know what you were feeling like, hey, there's not enough resources, being allocated here to protect our property and our buildings. We had just made me start taking things into her own hands and didn't defend it, you know, and that's where that's kind of the boiling point that we're getting to that. So dangerous and a good leader, would be able to deescalate this and bring a peaceful resolution to it instead of people real Lock and Load. And he know their home guns and before, you know, it might just be in a civil war, right? And everyone shooting everyone, and I don't think anyone wants that to happen. What's the time in touch with you yesterday. I think President Trump came because he actually cared and Joe Biden's doing it. Because, well, he has to know the political issue, right? I was very impressed with the press conference that that person. And, yeah, I think it was. I think it's, it's handled exactly how it should handle. Just a little too late, unfortunately, and that's all the blame again on 20 years for them. Most policies. I am. I'm just waiting for him to figure out how to rein in the Federal Reserve in Central Banking. Because that's actually the pillar that's going to damage the most people, the most Americans with it within the country due to the excessive printing of money. Yeah, it does to me. You know what I'd like. I said, I, I watched it for many years and I I feel both parties are kind of guilty of things in their own ways. And I think with Republican party is, is there just a little bit stagnant right there. A little little stale their, their, their, their family to move, you know, Blitzen. If a Republican party supposed to be on the side of the Constitution. Then like I said in my recall video, you know, there's a timer in place and he is doing things that is clearly anti-American and unconstitutional, right? Then we need to check them. When you take me to get rid of them. They're no good. Time in the Republic, guys are all wait, two years and then we'll see what happens. We will wait and see what's what happens. No, no, no, no. No. That kind of apathy has brought the country to where it is today. So that's that's my take on it. Yeah, the reason for that type of leaf is like a, like a sad young peace. Party is a machine and there's Milly multi millions of dollars that flow through it, and there is an inside club, right? So for some people within it, they have the wink and Nod that it's their turn to become governor because they did their time and, you know, whatever the name I ask them. So, when else are like me, who comes in with some fresh ideas, powerful ideas, actually and looks to shake things up. Really like that so much. I don't, I don't know. I have my own suspicions, but I can't say any until it's neon. They declare. So what do you do? Unless there's some kind of misconduct. What you share that to you that because you be used sparingly. I think that you were sick. Yeah, I believe we have misconduct this time and and if people real people lost their lives under this current recall, an Endeavor, right? I wouldn't, I'm not aware of anyone dying under the last recall, for the last recall from me. Do my research understanding was really based on some some balanced budget issues, right? We had some stomach. Yep unions. So yeah, so it was very different scenario here. See what I did wrong to Warrant that. So he wanted to balance the state budget. And this is the individuals were required to balance out our own budgets. Right? We don't get off the hook for that. But for some reason governments don't have to do that. They can spend, you know, forever and ever and ever. And Walker was finally at, you know, someone that's okay. And not feel that we have to balance the budget and he hadn't had to make the tough choices to do so and that's what he did. Social Security. Yeah, there's a lot of people ask my opinion on that and so it like you said, that is a federal program. So that was just more of an educational video. Nothing. I should really have any control over but I put it out there for people to understand why a social security is in trouble. Why is already been depleted and how much is going to be a further burden on the younger generation. If we keep the program that exact same way it is today. It's the point that I want to do. By this weekend, it's been. Okay. That's great. I appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time. All right. Take care of Patrick.

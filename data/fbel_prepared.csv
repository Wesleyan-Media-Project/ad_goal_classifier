I spend significant time representing healthcare providers, so I see systemic problems with our health system up close. Everything from the PASSE system, to holes in the Arkansas Works Medicaid Expansion, to providers struggling to stay in business because they aren’t getting paid for their services.   Here’s the thing:  Expanding access to healthcare in Arkansas is one of the very best investments we could possibly make in our state’s economy. Healthcare is a massive part of every local economy:  Small businesses can’t survive where there is no access to healthcare, and towns that lose hospitals or clinics tend to dry up.   Here’s what I want to work on in the State Legislature:   1. Expand Arkansas Works coverage to include more vulnerable Arkansans, so that our rural clinics and hospitals don’t close. The Medicaid expansion has been a boon to Arkansas’s economy, and I’ll fight efforts to undo it because it’s saved Arkansas lives and Arkansas healthcare providers.   2. Work to make sure Arkansans with pre-existing conditions can be covered by their insurance provider at rates that aren’t predatory.   3. We have to get prescription drug prices down, and this is urgent especially for seniors and Arkansans on fixed incomes. If an Arkansan needs a medication that will save their life, they should get that medication and it shouldn’t drive them into bankruptcy.   As Arkansas ages, and as our kids grow up into our community - we owe them healthcare solutions, not just more talk.  www.AshleyForArkansas.com",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

x_1652950271545771,"Two months ago, we learned that President Trump apparently ignored reports of Russian targeting of U.S. Marines in Afghanistan. That story appears to have been forgotten and given the daily outrageous conduct by this Administration, it is disturbing yet not surprising. Maybe it’s being investigated and we’ll get some answers in due time.  Yet, here we are again. I mentioned before that I have a daughter in the U.S. Marines and I would like to say more about that. She is a Second Lieutenant and in two weeks she will finish her training and begin her career as an officer in the service of her country.  This is all a new world for me since and aside from grandfathers who served in World War II, I have no personal connection with the military. But, as any American, I was raised to respect and honor their service and sacrifice. Anybody who has studied history would have to appreciate this, from the American Revolution to the Civil War to today.   I don’t personally know any other moms here who have children in the military now although I am certain I represent many who live in my district. Looking for information on her “graduation” I found the Facebook group for The Basic School (TBS). TBS is the level of training after Officer Candidate School. It’s great to see the pictures of the training and individual stories of those in training. However, every Sunday the site posts a picture and story of a Marine killed in action over the years. A reality check of what it means to be a Marine.  Are they “losers”, “suckers”? According to our President, they are.   In politics, there is a lot of empty rhetoric, lots of talk and no action. “Support the troops” comes to mind. What does that even mean? Putting a flag sticker on your car? Making a Facebook post?   I’m a Democrat so I see that Republicans have appropriated the patriotic, pro-military position. Where are they now? Are they choosing to support the worst President we have ever had over our members of the Armed Forces? I, however, refuse to defer to them on who is more patriotic, or who supports the troops more. I’m going to say it: I support the troops and I am calling on all my colleagues and especially my Republican opponent, an Army veteran herself, to stand up to this horrible president and distance themselves from his abhorrent rhetoric.   My daughter is most definitely not a “sucker” or loser”. She is a classically trained harpist who graduated from the top program in the country. She trained and worked for three years in Philadelphia as a professional paramedic saving countless lives. She is an amazing sister to her six siblings and has proven to me she can do anything she sets her mind to. She has chosen to be an officer in the United State Marine Corps and I could not be prouder.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Our secret weapon: We've identified 7 million high-potential, progressive voters across the 14 most important battleground states who might otherwise stay home on Election Day. If we can get just over 1% of those 7 million people to vote for the Biden-Harris ticket, Trump will almost certainly lose. One percent. That's it.

x_1024025138049363,"In my district to date, 11,300 or 61% of Democratic voters have applied to vote by mail compared to 4,600 or 25% of Republicans. The surge of enthusiasm we are seeing in Democratic voters in Pennsylvania is scaring the bejesus out of Republicans in Harrisburg. Their fear of a blue wave has caused them to embrace every trick they can find in the voter suppression handbook, including plotting to ignore the will of voters and using an archaic loophole in the United States Constitution that potentially could allow them to seat their own set of pro-Trump Electoral College electors in defiance of election results.  Voter suppression tactics are nothing new for the right wing but in this election their conniving has taken on an air of desperation as Harrisburg Republicans answer the clarion call of Donald Trump to undermine mail-in-voting and voters' confidence in the outcome of the election. Their goal is to create chaos, setting the stage for legal challenges to election results that growing evidence suggests will not be in their favor. Their full-frontal embrace of voter suppression tactics includes:  Attempting to shorten the time period in which voters may request a mail-in ballot Trying to eliminate satellite ballot drop-boxes  Appealing to the United States Supreme Court to reverse a ruling made by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court requiring election authorities to accept mail-in ballots received up to three days after November 3, as long as the ballots are postmarked on or before Election Day (a ruling made necessary because of Republican attempts to impede the Post Office’s ability to process mail-in ballots in a timely manner) Refusing to allow election authorities to begin counting ballots before Election Day Eliminating the requirement that poll watchers must be from the county where they seek to serve as a credentialed election observer And, to make matters worse, Donald Trump is hell-bent on stacking the Supreme Court in his favor in the event the high court has to serve as the final arbitrator in any election disputes.  Be assured that the Governor, legislative leaders and Democratic Party officials are anticipating and preparing for an array of legal challenges and electoral eventualities. Unfortunately, I do not believe we have a level playing field. We would all like to have confidence in our system of justice and electoral process but early indications raise legitimate concerns as to what extremes our opponents will go.  There is one sure-fired way to counter the chaos the Republicans are seeking to create. We must win this election decisively and we must flip the Pennsylvania House from red to blue. We need a victory that does not leave one scintilla of doubt as to the outcome. We must make this election challenge-proof and have a new majority in the legislature to prevent any further electoral shenanigans.  To that end, if you applied to vote by mail, follow the voting instructions (don’t forget the secrecy envelope) and mail your ballot as soon as you get it or take it to a designated drop box location. If you are not voting by mail, consider voting early in person at the Chester County Voter Services office from now through Election Day or at one of two satellite offices beginning October 5, 2020. If you plan to vote at your polling place in person on Election Day, please bring a friend or family member, vote early and stay safe.  Vote! Vote! Vote!

The GOP strategy to win is to use their billionaire donors to flood battleground states with fear mongering, racist ads and messaging to rally their base toward Trump. We can’t match them dollar for dollar, but luckily, we don't have to.   Our secret weapon: We've identified 7 million high-potential, progressive voters across the 14 most important battleground states who might otherwise not vote. If we can get just over 1% of those 7 million people to vote for the Biden-Harris ticket, Trump will almost certainly lose. One percent. That's it.  But voter turnout programs like these are expensive. We have to purchase thousands of ads, send millions of text messages, and create customized videos—then do it over and over again until the very last vote is counted.  We need your support to power this critical effort, especially in these last few weeks and days before Nov. 3. Can you chip in now to help us turn out the vote?

And he’s afraid you’ll figure that out before Nov. 3.  ❌ He pretends to be a moderate while voting time and again with the most extreme wing of his own party and mocking voters who disagree with him.  ❌ He accepts campaign contributions from supporters who want to siphon public tax dollars to support private schools.  ❌ He believes that Statehouse lawmakers know more about women’s healthcare than their doctors, and he will continue to attack women if he is re-elected.  ❌ When thousands of women marched to make their voices heard, he mocked them on social media and called them fat.  ❌ As a city-county councillor, he had an opportunity to stand up for same-sex marriage, and he refused. And as a State Senator, he had the opportunity to fight for a real hate crimes bill; instead, he stood on the sidelines and we now have the most watered-down hate crimes bill in the entire country.

His lackey, postmaster general Louis DeJoy, has made changes to slow down the mail and displaced experienced USPS staff ahead of November's elections. The head of the House subcommittee overseeing the Postal Service called the changes “deliberate sabotage.”  Slowing down the mail means a delay in delivering lifesaving medications and unemployment checks—and delaying millions of mail-in votes so they go uncounted or invalidated in November. The people hit the hardest are those in rural areas and older Americans who tend to rely more heavily on the Postal Service.  That’s why MoveOn is creating a powerful TV ad campaign about Trump’s attacks on the USPS aimed at seniors in the swing states most important to Trump—the same voters who are at the highest risk of the coronavirus and most reliant on the Postal Service. These seniors are a key constituency that Trump needs to win in November for his re-election.  We need to keep this ad on the air for as long as we can, but to do that, we need a consistent stream of funding.

He even tweeted to delay the election - a decision completely out of his authority.   The truth? Vote-by-mail is the safest way for millions to vote this election.

And in a new poll, 50% of younger voters say they don't have the resources or knowledge they need to vote by mail in November. Election data show that the ballots of young people and people of color—both pivotal Democratic constituencies—are being rejected at disproportionately high rates. If enough mail-in ballots in battleground states are tossed out, that could tip the election and hand Trump a second term.   With Trump’s intensifying efforts to attack mail-in voting, it’s crucial that every single voter has the information and resources they need to properly and safely vote this November. Which is why we’re working hard to create video ads explaining the voting process and to target these ads to crucial Democratic voters—young voters, voters of color, and first-time voters—in 10 critical battleground states.

Sundays are special, even peaceful, days when some join friends and family for worship services, sit down with children and grandparents for a meal or just relax and take in a football game. Unfortunately, not every family gets to enjoy these kinds of wholesome experiences.  Of all the actions Donald Trump has taken as President, many of us have found nothing more horrific than his policy of separating migrant children from their parents at our border. This policy has once again come into sharper focus with recent reports that our government cannot locate the parents of more than 500 separated migrant children and reunite them with their families.  This should come as no surprise to anyone. NBC News disclosed a Justice Department memo written in 2017 after federal prosecutors conducted a family separation “pilot” program and determined that children 12 and younger should not be separated because most would not be capable of finding their way back to their parents on their own.  In July of 2019, I introduced a resolution calling for the Pennsylvania House to condemn the Trump administration's cruel treatment of migrant families...  The Republican majority did not even allow debate on my resolution. By remaining silent and not stepping up to question the President’s family separation policies, the House majority's leaders and members were complicit in in the separation of children from their parents. I absolutely do not believe Republican voters in my district support the separation of children from their families further demonstrating how the right-wing majority that controls Harrisburg is out of step with local Republicans and nearly everyone else in our communities.  There are critics who say I should “stay in my lane”, the treatment of migrant children is a federal issue. I say to them, as a mother and as an elected official who represents thousands of people who truly care about this issue, this is my lane.  The insensitivity and lack of leadership on this issue displayed by the Republican majority in Harrisburg is further evidence as to why we need to flip the Pennsylvania House form red to blue. Some would say this is simply partisan rhetoric but I say it is more.  Character is not only on the ballot in the Presidential election. Character is also on the ballot in state legislative races here in Pennsylvania. Do you want a legislature that blindly and enthusiastically embraces the cruelest policies of Donald Trump without question, or do you want a new majority that legislates with humanity and empathy?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Even though they try to wrap their policies in different names (like “democratic socialism”)—it’s ultimately just socialism.  But how are so many people—especially young people—seduced by the false promises made by Karl Marx? And most importantly—Why is socialism so dangerous to the freedom and liberty promised to us by the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution?  These are the primary questions we aim to answer in our latest Teaching Freedom eBook titled, “Marx and the False Communist Promise.”  So, we’ve asked Dr. David Azerrad—the renowned professor of political philosophy for The Fund for American Studies, and research fellow at Hillsdale College’s Kirby Center in Washington D.C.—to help us understand the false communist promise made by Marx himself.  Get your free copy today and learn answers to the following questions:  ... How the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels have powerfully shaped the modern radical left-wing mindset in America—and throughout the world?  ... Which aspects of modern society have been used by the radical left to replace Marx’s teaching on the class system?  ... What is the radical left’s operating assumption in our modern times? And,  ...

A Senior Property Tax Exemption? It's a good idea. Our seniors built this country. They made America what it is. We want them to come to the Kenai Peninsula to enjoy their golden years. When the idea came forward to scale back the exemption from $350,000 to $200,000, I voted to put it on the ballot for the people to decide and they said no. That's the system at work. I would never shut the door on decisions like that without your input.  Compare that to Rep. Sarah Vance, who supported budget cuts that took senior benefits from our most vulnerable seniors without any warning. Those benefits are restored for now, but how safe are they when she has no real plan to balance the budget?  Here's just a sample of what I have done for seniors: ✅ In 2016, my constituent Peter Zuyus asked me to help create a Senior Citizen Advisory Task Force for the Borough, to advise local government on Senior Issues. I worked with Republican Assemblymember Wayne Ogle to get that passed. The only reason we don't have that representation today is that it was vetoed by then-Mayor Mike Navarre. ✅ Mayor Pierce and I cosponsored an increase in CARES Act funding to our Senior Citizen Centers from $10,000 to $50,000 to assist our seniors with COVID related expenses for reopening. ✅ This June, Anchor Point Resident and Alaska Commission on Aging Board Member Nona Safra invited all elected officials on the Kenai Peninsula—including my opponent—to learn about the needs of our community Senior Centers. I was the only elected official to take the opportunity to tour our senior centers with Nona.  My record speaks for itself.

Right now there are decisions being made that will impact whether Native people can go to the doctor, whether Native land and water rights are protected, and whether Native families and communities will get the vital services needed to survive.   The Trump administration is doing everything it can to keep Native people and communities from being fully counted: cutting off the U.S. census early, making it very hard for people to vote in Indian Country – and now, they are trying to steal a Supreme Court Justice seat. We can’t let that happen.  While we've been under attack before, we're stronger than ever before to fight back.  Tell your Senators to ensure that Native people have a voice in our democracy, including a full and fair census count, and taking specific steps to assure that our votes are all counted in the upcoming election.  The stakes are incredibly high, and they are trying to silence us in any way they can.  Every issue that Indian Country cares about – Tribal sovereignty, health care, Indian child welfare, land and water rights and more – is impacted by the Supreme Court.

Many conservatives think that the uninsured are just lazy and trying to live off the rest of us. But here’s five examples of why they’re wrong: Uninsured patients seen today*:      1. 33-year-old mother of five, married, husband works full-time, she works full-time as a home health aide, is currently on a chronic medication that cost between $150 and $200 per month.     2. 33-year-old mother of three, homemaker, husband works full-time as a trucker, she is on 2 chronic medications which cost over $200 a month     3. 49-year-old woman, homemaker, has advanced rheumatoid arthritis but has been unable to see a rheumatologist, she needs to be on a biologic medication to prevent destruction of her joints which will cost over $1000 a month.     4. 47-year-old man, runs his own business, has an undiagnosed endocrinologic problem, and has had a heart attack. He needs an extensive workup which will likely cost thousands of dollars and he is taking over a dozen chronic medications.     5. 46-year-old man, former contractor, disabled because of the severe injury to his brachial plexus but has not qualified for disability, thus far he has undergone two surgeries and needs extensive occupational therapy, but cannot work because of his injury.         Many of these same conservatives also claim to be Christian. However, they seem to have forgotten or never read what Christ said in Matthew 25:  “...what you do unto the least of my children you do unto me...”  If any of the above patients were Christ himself, would you deny him care?  *This was not an unusual day, fully 1/3 of my office’s gross income comes directly from patients.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

But they’ve done a lot more damage than just giving him a free pass to commit crimes and invite foreign interference into our elections.

He knows if we all come together, he's going to lose. He’s desperately posturing to sow confusion and doubt about voting and encouraging voter suppression. He’s even refused at times to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses.  Fortunately, the election’s outcome isn’t up to Trump. It’s up to us. It’s critical that everyone votes and as early as possible. It’s also equally important that we be determined and prepared to protect the outcome of the record-high voting we’ll see this year if there is an attempt to overturn the results.   That's why, in addition to our full-throttled get-out-the-vote effort to help deliver a Biden win by an undeniable margin, we’re also committed to safeguard our democracy in case Trump tries to steal the election. MoveOn is joining more than 100 other partners in the Protect the Results coalition. People from all walks of life, all over the country are preparing to nonviolently join together in solidarity should Trump seek to undermine the voting process this country has undertaken for generations. We're raising our hands now and committing to take nonviolent action nationwide to ensure everyone's vote is counted, if such action is needed.  It's up to us—not Trump—to decide who our next president is. Vote—and make a plan for Nov. 4 and after to protect the results.

His YouTube channel has posted 9X more videos than Biden's. And the campaign claims to have half a billion video views over the last four months alone.

Independence important  Kris Bledsoe is the ideal candidate for Yamhill County treasurer.  She not only has all the all the essential business and educational qualifications for the office, but also brings a long and successful history of experience managing public funds.  Kris currently is an active member of the Yamhill County Investment Advisory Committee, attending all meetings. Based on her active participation, she has earned the endorsement of the current county treasurer, Mike Green.  Kris thoroughly understands the complexity of the county’s investment policy and the constraints placed therein. In his endorsement, Green said Kris brought a level of interest and dedication unmatched by either past or present committee members.  County treasurer is a non-partisan position. To be truly effective, the treasurer must be independent, not beholding to others.  Kris brings the knowledge required and the independence necessary to best benefit the county. Her knowledge of the investment strategy required by Yamhill County financial portfolio is broad and deep.  She practices a conservative investment philosophy. And she is beholden to no one — no political party or philosophy.   The treasurer is charged with delivering the best possible investment returns on the county portfolio. This takes an intelligent, experienced and dedicated financial professional.   Kris fits this description perfectly. She brings everything we need to this position in order to assure the citizens of Yamhill County their tax dollars will be responsibly managed and invested.

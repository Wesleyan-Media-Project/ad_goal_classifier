Together, we showed the world that this movement is more committed and fired up than ever to carry on the fight for justice and equality that RBG led for so long.

A Senior Property Tax Exemption? It's a good idea. Our seniors built this country. They made America what it is. We want them to come to the Kenai Peninsula to enjoy their golden years. When the idea came forward to scale back the exemption from $350,000 to $200,000, I voted to put it on the ballot for the people to decide and they said no. That's the system at work. I would never shut the door on decisions like that without your input.  Compare that to Rep. Sarah Vance, who supported budget cuts that took senior benefits from our most vulnerable seniors without any warning. Those benefits are restored for now, but how safe are they when she has no real plan to balance the budget?  Here's just a sample of what I have done for seniors: ✅ In 2016, my constituent Peter Zuyus asked me to help create a Senior Citizen Advisory Task Force for the Borough, to advise local government on Senior Issues. I worked with Republican Assemblymember Wayne Ogle to get that passed. The only reason we don't have that representation today is that it was vetoed by then-Mayor Mike Navarre. ✅ Mayor Pierce and I cosponsored an increase in CARES Act funding to our Senior Citizen Centers from $10,000 to $50,000 to assist our seniors with COVID related expenses for reopening. ✅ This June, Anchor Point Resident and Alaska Commission on Aging Board Member Nona Safra invited all elected officials on the Kenai Peninsula—including my opponent—to learn about the needs of our community Senior Centers. I was the only elected official to take the opportunity to tour our senior centers with Nona.  My record speaks for itself.

The Republicans know Trump’s poll numbers have recently sunk even further—and could take down the GOP-controlled Senate with him. This opens up a golden opportunity to flip the Senate.  Which is why MoveOn has a plan to invest $2 million in a massive ad blitz across three key Senate states to defeat Martha McSally in Arizona, Susan Collins in Maine, and Lindsey Graham in South Carolina.

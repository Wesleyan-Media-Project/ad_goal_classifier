Well, and I think he while he was saying that to certainly you're right Daniela I what what I was taking away from it was  Also that we really need Congress to do something in other words. I think the FED has done about as much as they can do they'll keep trying to do things. But we really need something out of the Congress similar to the cares act and whether or not they can get that done before the election. I hope they can we've heard virtually every member of the feds say that we need that I think we do.  I looked at an article just today Daniela that said in May a hundred thousand businesses in the United States had closed permanently in May and that was when we had some of the payroll protection as well as the unenhanced unemployment benefit. We need both of those again. We probably don't need the $1200 per household sort of checks, you know up to a certain level of wage earner, but we definitely need  The enhanced unemployment and I think the payroll protection. Otherwise we're going to see another hundred thousand places permanently closed their doors and that'll mean the recovery when it comes will be very tepid much like it was in 2009. So a concentrated effort to save small business John. Yes, exactly. I'm not worried about Apple. I'm not worried about most big companies, but I am worried about all the little  On pawn shops and just like its consumers that really lifts the economy here in the United States.

We need the small businesses because without them all the people, they employ all the people they service it'll be a much different America for the next three to five years if we let 200 or 250 thousand businesses die just because we're beat playing  X and John in his message to Congress if we read between the lines there is he basically seeing where an environment of QE Infinity? Yeah, I think he is and yes, we're going to keep rates low for a long time. Although as we've seen over the past week. Even when the FED is keeping rates at or near zero the 10% are the 10 year bond rather has made a pretty dramatic move and the TLT which is an ETF.  The tracks Bond movement has dropped rather dramatically after not having moved at all. I mean but we just saw a drop from I think about 164 to 158 in the last little bit for that TLT and we see a lot of speculation from Big institutions that it'll go lower than that.

So in other words Goldfield GV some XCX, those are two examples of some of the stocks that we're really looking at hard right now as far as you know providing cement for  Are roads some X as well as building of course and GV, which is an infrastructure play all over the board gold Fields. It's not a gold miner, right? But that's the name nonetheless. That would be either President Trump or President Biden. If it is President Biden, I think you could concentrate even more so on green energy in other words. I don't know that Elon Musk needs the Boost  Tesla's still do fine. But SunPower spw are probably a number of non fracking plays. In other words. I might even be long solar and short fracking because I would anticipate that even though he hasn't said that he's going to shut fracking down. He's already said no new permits for frackers. And so I understand why he hasn't come out hard against it because if he  Does he loses Ohio and Texas and Pennsylvania votes? Maybe he doesn't lose those States Daniela, but obviously those are significant states that are involved in fracking. I don't think either candidate can afford to lose those. So not surprisingly neither one wants to come out against fracking. What do you do with a stock like apple here John? They're not seeing they may release a new iPhone any time now, right and we're thinking both of us. I think next week. They've just made the announcement.  In April, October 13th, sorry and I think a5g iPhones a big deal. It's not just because it's a little bit faster because it is only really a little bit faster for most of us. We wouldn't notice very much how much faster it is, but for applications like GPS, it'll be much better for applications like self-driving cars Daniela. It'll be absolutely necessary. So I think  Apple's going to do just fine, but I don't think that this is one you want to step out of in other words as much as I say infrastructure and some value stocks have Biden wins. I think either way just like those infrastructure plays Apple wins because we're all Apple junkies and those of us that can afford it will buy that new iPhone as soon as it comes out John finally. How about the safe haven plays? What can we expect?  From metals like gold, I think as long as the FED is as active as they're likely to be for the next three to five years gold probably gets into the 2200 to the Ounce range not right away. But over the next year, I would look for about a 10 percent appreciation or a little bit more as far as silver and platinum. I think they do well also Bitcoin and  related coins that are of limited Supply rather than Unlimited Supply coins. I think those will do very well as well because I think Europe and the United States are likely to keep the pedal to the metal as far as keep rates below zero or near zero in one of those two cases Jon najarian. I appreciate your your comments and thoughts today. Finally. I know you've been involved in many things. What are you up to these days? What do you really focusing on? Um,  I actually am involved with a couple of cryptocurrency boards. I'm involved in a couple of companies that do digital printing or I'm on the board of black Buffalo. It's a privately held company based in Korea that does large-scale printing of when we say like this kind of printing printing houses imagine that like these guys their machines are as big as  as mostly as big as a small house your tummy. You can make me a two-door garage and print it. Yeah. Wow, just print it out. I mean the things that these guys did, you know Apple used, of course this technology to make a lot of the prototypes that they were making years and years ago and now it's moved all the way into construction. And so that's an area I'm focused on as well because you can make things really fast.  And do it right there on site. So the transportation is not the issue and it's not the issue with Home Depot or anything else. It's really wild stuff fascinating wild indeed Jon najarian. Thank you so much for joining us.

None of it really makes sense, but it’s caused at least a few people to clutch their pearls and declare “No More Aloha Shirts For Me!” as if we must retreat from what we love because jerks love the same things. Hawai’i is the most Asian American, the most multiracial, arguably the most beautiful state of our Union, and the aloha spirit is a Pacific wave that continues to wash away the suffering of the world. I’m not giving up on aloha or aloha shirts...  I think the racists’ aloha shirts are a strange acknowledgment that White Supremacy is retiring and wants a kind of Kluau Klux Klan to celebrate...  Maybe all of this is a pun spun by Pele, Hawai’ian goddess of volcanoes and fire, forcing us to make new land between us, while also threatening destruction...

I'm amused when I hear people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution.  Suddenly reading into it a whole series of Provisions that are not there. But this is absolutely within precedent. There have been 14 different cases where the Senate has confirmed someone in the last year of a president's term and this is not a three-year term. It's a four-year term evidently. It isn't enough Republicans to merely shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States of America.  They must have attached the Supreme Court to Republicans have obstructed the Congress obstructed our president and now they want to obstruct the court as long as they continue to hold that Supreme Court seat vacant so that Donald Trump can fill it Senate Republicans are tied at the hip to Donald Trump and are not doing their job historically. This has not been viewed.  As a question, there's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off. Here's that's not in the constitutional text.

I figured I'll just jump in to give you my opinions on what happened in the first presidential debate. If you missed the debate, I'm going to give you a quick recap of what happened. Ah, ha ha ha would you laugh you like to respond to that was very informative first things first. We need new debate rules people Chris Wallace. Thank you for your service. And I hope that you have a lot of money for your therapy. You made it.  Valiant effort but you were not ready for this because no human being could have been ready for this. They don't need a moderator for this thing. They need a UFC ref Dana White get on it. Trump would not shut up right now. He's still in his bedroom complaining about how crooked Hillary rigged election that he wants. She totally stole it, but I got it. I brought it back. I grabbed it from her. I totally had it Pastor tooth placement on yeah, that's what I did. I grabbed it from Hillary. I mean at one point Chris Wallace was this close.  Two looking at Trump and saying nigga you got to shut the fuck up.  That was Chris Wallace losing his mind. So look moderators. You need to figure out how to handle Trump at a debate because this is not good for the nation. It doesn't work to just say mr. President, please. Mr. President, please please mr. President, please have you ever asked a toddler, please? Please put down the matches, please put that your house will be burned down around you. That's why milania scoffs the hand you gotta slap. The hand can be talking to a toddler. I'm telling you man. They need to switch things up need to figure something out do  Anything give the next moderator a spray bottle just to Spritz them anytime. They interrupt. I promise you Trump will be quiet because his head turns into a gremlin if it gets wet just spray him. You know, what even better give Trump $100 for every time he lets Biden finish a sentence. Yeah. I mean the money is a great incentive for him. And now that we've seen the tax returns, we know that he needs it and whoever decided on this format needs to be fired because I don't know about you at home, but I have never and I mean never wanted to see a commercial.  Shal break more badly in my life. I cannot do 90 straight minutes of this shit ever again. It was brutal. There's got to be a commercial break every five minutes and during those commercial breaks. Every AD should be for antidepressants or some drug that has side effects that make you forget the last four years and honestly if you went to a commercial in the middle of this thing, I bet even the guys in the ad would be flustered and we still thrown off by Donald Trump. They'd be like a I was gonna tell you about the the cat litter or hotdogs or  I can't remember anything I do. I'm sorry. I guys I don't want this ad is about that guy just kept on these debates need fact Checkers. Why am I the only person who steals it guys debates need fact Checkers because otherwise people can just stand on the stage and say whatever they want and there are no consequences zero NADA zilch every time a candidate says a lie, there should be some sort of like sign that they lied like maybe a brick should come down on this side of the screen, you know like Tetris  And then as they lie, it'll just gradually build up higher and higher until it covers their face. I mean the best part for Trump is that five minutes into the debate. He'll finally have his wall. There are so many places where there is no truth Twitter Facebook partisan news networks these debates at the very least should be a place where people can tune in and expect some kind of fact check, you know, you can't just have both candidates making things up if they're going to make things up as like you don't know is Biden telling the truth. I think so is Trump would you that's definitely a lie, but no one's saying anything you can.  Have them decide when its allies like the NBA finals and then all of a sudden they're like, oh, yeah, you can call your own fouls. No that's chaos. You need an actual ref on the court people. I mean the one upside of this whole night is now we know what the fight club sequel look like in 40 years. That's the one outside. In fact, that's what we should do, which is let these guys wrestle just let them physically wrestle each other because the reality is everyone's made up their mind. All right, there's no such thing as an undecided voter. It's just people too embarrassed to say how they'll vote. So  entertain America at least with two old men wrestling and the winner gets a free hip replacements. So I don't know guys fresh after the debate. What is my take away? I don't actually know I mean, I don't know how Biden did because Trump did more interrupting than Kanye West in a room full of Taylor Swift's it sounded less like a debate and more like the radio was stuck catching to station grab wouldn't and Hickory. Hey Lorenzo. This guy's a clown girl, please. Mr. Pritchard. I can't believe that by now.  Managed to keep any train of thought that was impressive you want to talk about being a copis mentis for being president pay attention while Trump is trying to interrupt you the whole time. It's like having a little devil on your shoulder, but they're not trying to convince you of anything. They're just trying to mess you up. Yeah, that's what union 50 there - that it's a lab. Where is my baby? I was watching that debate and I kept forgetting where I was. I actually hope Biden was taking drugs because that's the only way I was able to get through the debates and as for Trump's performance, two things one now we  Finally know what it would be like if he read his Twitter feed out loud and too. I can't believe how hard his brain malfunctioned when they asked him to denounce white supremacists. Will you denounce the proud boys? Mr. President? Well, yeah the prayer but we're stand back and stand by boys. So after the first debates, I don't know if anybody wants. All I know is for the next debate. I'm going to stand back from the TV and stand by a bottle of wine.  We'll see you guys tomorrow for the Fallout from the first presidential debate on The Daily social distancing show debate.

Let's really sit down and talk about what we learned, you know, take some time to analyze the policy disagreements think through the important issues pass the nuances of the question is yes is the radical left. Will you shut up this and you graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. This is so good.  Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged. That's not true. Is it to talkin use? Wait a minute, you get the final word know it's hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me. This a let me just tell you there's nothing smart about Yu-Gi-Oh 47 years. You've done nothing. I fear the worst America has ever had. Oh snap. These guys were bickering so much Canada call the cops to complain about the noise. I have never seen a debate like that in my life.  To be honest, I've never seen anything like that in my life. Honestly, it's it seemed less like a presidential debate and more like a fight that you over here in a booth at Denny's while you shut up you clown you got no class. I got no class you got terrible grades and your son's a cocaine you piece of shit. You don't talk about my son you listen. Yeah. I like could I get the moons over my hammy with the orange juice, please? Yeah, that'll be  Adult thank you so much. You got drunk and you here on your own daughter. I wasn't drunk. I mean some of these insults will way more personal than you ever seen a debate. Especially Biden calling Trump a clown which guys I'm sorry, man is that's not fair to Trump. All right clowns. We're weird makeup. They have clothes that are too big for them. They're deeply sad even when they don't show it. Does that sound like Donald Trump to you now, let's just be clear the reason that this debate.  Eight was such a colossal train wreck is because Donald J. Trump was throwing grenades on the tracks and usually in a debate the moderators there to prevent things from getting out of hand, but last night's water rates a Chris Wallace was about a successful at stopping Trump as the popular vote. The country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I'm appealing to you sir to do that. Well and him too. Well frankly. You've been doing more interrupting. That's it.  And we will press have people that I'm the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer. Yes, sir. I understand you've agreed to the two minutes. So please let him have a sure you made it you made a point but an answer and there mr. President. I the answer the second subject is covid-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let's try to be serious about it true. You're doing it you're going to have a true gentleman is  I hate to raise my voice to me. Why shouldn't I be different than the two of you? So you've been talking to me this statement? I'm asking you I would love to know I would love to you know, if you want to switch seats, we could very quickly we can do that. Oh man, that is so sad. Trump was being such a child that Chris Wallace actually had to pull the do you want to switch seats move that English teachers use with their students and honestly, I'm glad that Trump didn't take him up on it because if Trump takes  Wallace's job then Wallace has to take over Trump's job. And I don't know if he has it in him to kill 200,000 people. But seriously though, I feel bad for Chris Wallace any moderator in a trump debate is basically a WWE ref, you know rarely stopping anyone you just there to get body-slammed every once in a while and people have been criticizing Wallace for how he handled the debate, but honestly guys, I don't know if another model rates are could have done better. I mean whether you like it or not Trump is the president of the United States, so what was Wallace?  Supposed to do ground him. There was no way to stop Trump last night. He interrupted Biden. He interrupted Wallace and there weren't any commercials last night. But if they were Trump would have interrupted those two guys. Are you tired of frequent nighttime bathroom trips will force back your prostate. Why is it just out of curiosity? He mayor of Moscow as wife gave you son three and a half million dollars, I guess relentless.  So look, this was not a Shining Moment In the American history books, right political observers refer to it as a shitshow a dumpster fire the worst debate in history and with all the interrupting and cross talking it might have even been hard to remember if anything important happened last night, but there was one moment that really stood out. Are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacist and militia groups and to say  That they need to stand down and not add to the violence and a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we've seen in Portland, I'm willing to do anything. I want to see people do it, sir. Do it say do you want to call him? What do you want to call him? Give me a name. Give me my surprise and right problem ISIS stand back and stand by but I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right way.  A problem is wow. There you have it folks Trump had an opportunity to be like white supremacist. I don't quit you instead. He's like stand by guys. I never know when I'm going to need you telling white supremacists to stand down and telling them to stand by are not the same thing. All right, that one little word makes a huge difference like the difference between a blowout and a blow job. Do not ask for the wrong one at Supercuts.  Again to the staff at Supercuts. I apologize. I hadn't slept and I didn't read the menu properly and even for that non condemnation Trump had to be dragged into it like no President should have have to be pressured this hard into condemning white supremacist. It's the easiest thing Trump did it so grudgingly. He was like one of those guys who refuses to make real apologies what I'm supposed to apologize for tailgating at your dad's funeral fine. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you're unable to have a good.  Time some of us are still living. And by the way, you know that you've truly botched your condemnation of a hate group. When that hate group says thank you for the endorsement. The proud boy is a far-right extremist group immediately celebrating the president's comments on social media. They went nuts on social media celebrating. They put out those words as a rallying cry stand back stand by within minutes. The group's members were posting on private social.  Are calling Trump's comments quote historic the New York Times reports that some group members labeled it as a tacit endorsement of their violent tactics while another posted the group is already seeing a spike in new recruits. Yes. Thanks to Donald Trump's failed condemnation. This hate group is now seeing an increase in recruits, which means in the history of Television that might be one of the worst answers ever given  And that's coming from someone who wants guess the number seven on Wheel of Fortune. I didn't know it had to be letters. That was like I was new to America the prop boys liked Donald Trump's answer so much that they even adopting it as their new slogan and that actually might piss off Trump because the one thing he definitely believes in is getting royalties. Well, nobody should be advocating the supremacy of the white man without giving Danny he's cut I'd be careful if I were the problems though because if there's one thing we know about Donald Trump, is that once he invests in you you about  Five years until you go bankrupt. So yes in a debate that consisted almost entirely of three old men trying to shout over each other. This one moment was horrifying enough to break out and get noticed and you know, it's bad when even Trump's own supporters are left saying you're done up the president. Well, he would not condemn white supremacists. I agree that the president made of made a bad error and not take that was a huge gaps. He was he was  Kind of like playing around. I didn't like that he equivocated when he could have slam dunk bat picking this book up if he should correct it because it corrected. I guess he didn't miss me Donald Trump grew the biggest lay up in the history of debates by saying not condemning white supremacist. I don't know if he didn't hear it, but he's got to clarify that right away. That's like are you against evil why the president didn't just knocked out of the park. I'm not sure. Yes.  Why didn't the president condemned white supremacy? Hmm? It's a real mystery. Maybe he didn't hear the question. Or maybe he misspoke. Or maybe he thought they said Sprite supremacists and he's really into Sprite. I can't think of any other explanation Watson. By the way. Did you notice that even when Fox people acknowledge Trump did something really bad? They still give him the benefit of the doubt. I wish I had friends that were that loyal, you know, if I shat my pants and  Like none of my friends would be like Trevor didn't shit himself his but misspoke. Look Trump's friends can play dumb about this all they want but I don't know why I don't know at this point. People are still acting surprised when he refuses to denounce white supremacists because as you may remember this is not exactly a new thing for him. I think there's blame on both sides. You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were  very fine people on both sides Rising threat. I don't really there are white supremacist groups and individuals like that who support you some of whom you've even retweeted. Well that I know nothing about I mean, I don't know about retweeting. I mean you retweet somebody and turns out to be a white supremacist. I know nothing about these groups that are supporting me. Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don't want his Vote or that of other white supremacists in this election. I don't know anything about  David Duke, okay. I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I have to look if you would send me a list of the groups. I will do research on them. And certainly I would disavow of I thought there was something wrong, but you may have questions in there that are totally fine and it would be very unfair. So give me a list of the groups and I'll let you know. Okay, I mean, I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but I don't know it honestly. I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I've ever met.  Met him I pretty sure I didn't meet him and I just don't know anything about them. Yeah, it's actually hard to keep track of all the times that Trump had the chance to be anti-racist and didn't the only thing he avoids more than condemning white supremacist is paying taxes and keep in mind. This is the same guy who has strong opinions on everything. I mean the man tweeted for a month about Robert Pattinson's love like Robert Pattinson AKA Twilight, but then when it comes to white supremacy, he's like, hey, man, I don't get involved in other people's business.  As you know, you do your own thing. The truth is people sometimes not having an opinion is having an opinion if someone's like I don't know some Urban London, so I'm not going to say anything bad about him and you should stop talking to that person or at least don't get on a plane with them. So look I get why his supporters want to act like Trump's proud boys moment last night was some kind of accidental or unintentional Gaff, but if you see someone making the same mistake over,  Over and over again why some point you have to accept that? It's not a mistake. It's their belief. The Daily Show Comedy Central  Trump Stands By White Supremacists In Debate ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Mayor Pete pointed out the urgency to ensure our children receive a quality education. Our students have missed an enormous amount of instructional time since Hurricane Micheal in 2018 and the present-day COVID-19 Pandemic. My opponent voted to defund public education, which equated to $950 million during a crisis! Despite being almost 900 miles away, Mayor Buttigieg realizes that Georgia House District 173 needs an adaptable leader who will fight for our children and families first. Mayor Buttigieg also noted my push for Medicaid expansion. Expanding Medicaid would help our rural hospitals remain open, provide coverage to over 470,000 Georgians, revive our economy, and, most importantly, save lives! Decatur and Thomas county both have 15-20% of the state’s uninsured rate while Grady County has a whopping 20-25%. Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s endorsement shines a light on the ineffectiveness of the incumbent to deliver when we needed her the most.

Check out our first “Union 411: 2020 Election Special” video, which takes a look at rising economic inequality and explains why Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the leaders we need — ready to reward work over wealth and working families over corporations.  This November the decisions that we make at The Ballot Box will have huge consequences. And for most of us it comes down to where the candidates stand on the issues that matter to you your family and your community over the next several weeks. This series will shine a light on a few of the key issues and provide the 411 on what's at stake for working people.  Afscme members have always worked hard to make ends meet and these days it's just getting harder in America. The very rich are getting very much richer and everyone else is losing ground. And the last four years have made those inequalities worse consider this the wealthiest one percent of people in America control almost 40% of the wealth while the bottom 90%  Percent are left with less than 1/4 and because of generations of exclusionary policies and systemic racism. The wealth Gap is even greater for people of color. That's why I asked me fights for racial Justice and economic Justice. They go hand in hand. Now, let's take a look at where the candidates for president stand on this critical issue. Here's the 411 Donald Trump handed out one point nine trillion.  Dollars in tax cuts for the super rich on the other hand Joe Biden has committed to reverse tax cuts for the wealthy raise more revenue from corporations and the wealthiest point one percent and increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Joe Biden will pursue economic policies that reward work over wealth and Working Families over corporations afscme members across the country are ready to win.  Working people in 2020. That's why we've created virtual campaign field offices to equip us with the tools. We need to get out the vote early and safely to elect Joe Biden Kamala Harris and pro-worker candidates up and down the ballot an economy that gives a fair shake to everyone an end to the persistent racial gaps in jobs wages and wealth the ability to take care of our community.
